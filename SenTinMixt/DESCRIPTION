Description: Implements parsimonious mixtures of MSEN and MTIN
        distributions via expectation- maximization based algorithms
        for model-based clustering. For each mixture component,
        parsimony is reached via the eigen-decomposition of the scale
        matrices and by imposing a constraint on the tailedness
        parameter. This produces a family of 28 parsimonious mixture
        models for each distribution.
