Description: Visualize contact tracing data using a 'shiny' app and
        estimate the incubation or latency time of an infectious
        disease respecting the following characteristics in the
        analysis; (i) doubly interval censoring with (partly)
        overlapping or distinct windows; (ii) an infection risk
        corresponding to exponential growth; (iii) right truncation
        allowing for individual truncation times; (iv) different
        choices concerning the family of the distribution. For our
        earlier work, we refer to Arntzen et al. (2023)
        <doi:10.1002/sim.9726>. A paper describing our approach in
        detail will follow.
