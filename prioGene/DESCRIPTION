Description: In gene sequencing methods, the topological features of
        protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are often used, such
        as ToppNet <https://toppgene.cchmc.org>. In this study, a
        candidate gene prioritization method was proposed for
        non-communicable diseases considering disease risks transferred
        between genes in weighted disease PPI networks with weights for
        nodes and edges based on functional information.
