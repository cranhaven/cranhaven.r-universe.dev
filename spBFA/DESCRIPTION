Description: Implements a spatial Bayesian non-parametric factor
        analysis model with inference in a Bayesian setting using
        Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Spatial correlation is
        introduced in the columns of the factor loadings matrix using a
        Bayesian non-parametric prior, the probit stick-breaking
        process. Areal spatial data is modeled using a conditional
        autoregressive (CAR) prior and point-referenced spatial data is
        treated using a Gaussian process. The response variable can be
        modeled as Gaussian, probit, Tobit, or Binomial (using
        Polya-Gamma augmentation). Temporal correlation is introduced
        for the latent factors through a hierarchical structure and can
        be specified as exponential or first-order autoregressive. Full
        details of the package can be found in the accompanying
        vignette. Furthermore, the details of the package can be found
        in "Bayesian Non-Parametric Factor Analysis for Longitudinal
        Spatial Surfaces", by Berchuck et al (2019),
        <doi:10.1214/20-BA1253> in Bayesian Analysis.
