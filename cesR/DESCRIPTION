Description: Makes accessing and loading the Canadian Election Study
        (<http://www.ces-eec.ca/>, <https://ces-eec.arts.ubc.ca/>,
        <https://search1.odesi.ca/#/>) surveys into the R workspace
        more efficient by downloading a requested survey and loading it
        as a data object. This removes the need to locate, download,
        load, and change working directories when working with the
        Canadian Election Study surveys.
