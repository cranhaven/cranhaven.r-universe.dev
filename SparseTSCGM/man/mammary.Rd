\title{Microarray gene expression time course data for mammary gland development in mice}
 \description{
  The data contains 30 genes identified using cluster analysis from 12488 probe
  sets representing approximately 8600 genes.  The data are measured over 54 arrays of   
  3 replicates each on 18 time points 
  of the developmental stages of mammary gland in mice. 
  See Stein et al. (2004) for more details.
