# `wklsr`: Well-Known Locations in R

`wklsr` is the R port of [wkls](https://github.com/wherobots/wkls) and
makes it easy to find global administrative boundaries — from countries
to cities — using readable, chainable R syntax.

It fetches geometries from a mirror of [Overture Maps
Foundation](https://overturemaps.org/) GeoParquet data (version
2025-11-19.0) hosted on HuggingFace.

You can instantly get geometries in formats like Well-known Text (WKT),
Well-known Binaries (WKB), HexWKB, GeoJSON, and SVG:

``` r
library(wklsr)

# prints "MULTIPOLYGON (((-122.5279985 37.8155806...)))"
print(wkls$us$ca$sanfrancisco$wkt())

#prints "2025-11-19.0"
print(wkls$overture_version())
```

## Installation

``` r
install.packages(wklsr)
```

> This command also loads DuckDB with its related spatial extension.

## Quick Start

After installing `wklsr`, run the following commands to get started:

``` r
library(wklsr)

# Get country geometry
usa_wkt <- wkls$us$wkt()
print(sprintf("USA geometry: %s...", substr(usa_wkt, 1, 50)))

# Get state/region geometry
california_geojson <- wkls$us$ca$geojson()

# Get city geometry
sf_svg <- wkls$us$ca$sanfrancisco$svg()

# Check dataset version
print(sprintf("Using Overture Maps data: %s", wkls$overture_version()))

# Explore available data
print(sprintf("Countries: %d", nrow(wkls$countries())))
print(sprintf("Dependencies: %d", nrow(wkls$dependencies())))
print(sprintf("US regions: %d", nrow(wkls$us$regions())))
print(sprintf("CA counties: %d", nrow(wkls$us$ca$counties())))
```

## Handling namespace collisions

## Usage

### Accessing geometry

wklsr supports **up to 3 chained attributes**: 1.
**Country/Dependencies** (required) – must be a 2-letter ISO 3166-1
alpha-2 code (e.g. `us`, `de`, `fr`) 2. **Region** (optional) – must be
a valid region code suffix as specified by Overture (e.g. `ca` for
`US-CA`, `ny` for `US-NY`) 3. **Place** (optional) – a **name** match
against subtypes: `county`, `locality`, or `neighborhood`

Examples:

``` r
wkls$us$wkt()                          # country: United States
wkls$us$ca$wkt()                       # region: California
wkls$us$ca$sanfrancisco$wkt()          # city/county: San Francisco
wkls[["us"]][["ca"]][["sanfrancisco"]]$wkt() # dictionary-style access
```

#### Supported formats

`wklsr` supports the following formats:

-   `$wkt()` – Well-Known Text
-   `$wkb()` – Raw binary WKB
-   `$hexwkb()` – Hex-encoded WKB
-   `$geojson()` – GeoJSON string
-   `$svg()` – SVG path string

### Example: Find the administrative boundary of San Francisco, California

Chained expressions like `wkls$us$ca$sanfrancisco` return a WKL object.
Internally, this wkls_proxy object containing one or more rows
that match the given chain.

``` r
        id           country    region   subtype       name     
0  085718963fffff...   US       US-CA    county    San Francisco
```

In most cases, wklsr resolves to a single administrative boundary. But if
there are name collisions (e.g., both a county and a locality called
“San Francisco”), multiple rows may be returned.

By default, geometry methods like `$wkt()` will use the first matching
row.

### Helper methods

The following methods return Pandas DataFrames for easy exploration:

| Method | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `wkls$countries()` | List all countries |
| `wkls$dependencies()` | List all [dependencies](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema/reference/divisions/division/) |
| `wkls$us$regions()` | List regions in the US |
| `wkls$us$ca$counties()` | List counties in California |
| `wkls$us$ca$cities()` | List cities in California |
| `wkls$subtypes()` | Show all distinct division subtypes |

Some countries/dependencies may not have regions, so for those
countries/dependencies you can directly call either `$counties()` or
`$cities()`, to further explore the available data\$

``` r
wkls$fk$cities()
```

### Dataset information

You can check which version of the Overture Maps dataset is being used:

``` r
print(wkls$overture_version())
```

``` sh
> "2025-11-19.0"
```

> **Note**: The `overture_version()` method is only available at the
> root level, not on chained objects like `wkls$us$overture_version()`.

## How It Works

`wklsr` works in two stages:

### 1. In-memory GERS ID resolution

Your chained attributes — up to 3 levels — are parsed in this order:

1.  `country/dependency` → matched by ISO 2-letter code (e.g. `"us"`)
2.  `region` → matched using region code suffix as specified by Overture
    (e.g. `"ca"` → `"US-CA"`)
3.  `place` → fuzzy-matched against names in subtypes: `county`,
    `locality`, or `neighborhood`

This resolves to a wkls_proxy object containing metadata from the
in-memory wklsr table (stored in DuckDB). At this stage, no geometry is
loaded yet — only metadata (like id, name, region, subtype, etc.) is
queried from the database. When you print the proxy object or call a
geometry method, the actual data is retrieved via `dbGetQuery()`.

### 2. Geometry lookup using DuckDB

The geometry lookup is triggered only when you call one of the geometry
methods:

-   `$wkt()`
-   `$wkb()`
-   `$hexwkb()`
-   `$geojson()`
-   `$svg()`

At that point, `wklsr` uses the previously resolved **GERS ID** to query
the Overture **division_area** GeoParquet directly from S3.

The current Overture Maps dataset version can be checked with
`wkls$overture_version()`.
