Description: Allows for data to be transformed before using it to
        construct models. Builds structures to allow functions in the
        PMML package to output transformation details in addition to
        the model in the resulting PMML file. The Predictive Model
        Markup Language (PMML) is an XML-based language which provides
        a way for applications to define machine learning, statistical
        and data mining models and to share models between PMML
        compliant applications. More information about the PMML
        industry standard and the Data Mining Group can be found at
        <http://www.dmg.org>. The generated PMML can be imported into
        any PMML consuming application, such as Zementis Predictive
        Analytics products, which integrate with web services,
        relational database systems and deploy natively on Hadoop in
        conjunction with Hive, Spark or Storm, as well as allow
        predictive analytics to be executed for IBM z Systems mainframe
        applications and real-time, streaming analytics platforms.
