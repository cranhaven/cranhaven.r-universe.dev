Description: A multi-core R package that contains a set of tools based
        on copula graphical models for accomplishing the three
        interrelated goals in genetics and genomics in an unified way:
        (1) linkage map construction, (2) constructing linkage
        disequilibrium networks, and (3) exploring high-dimensional
        genotype-phenotype network and genotype- phenotype-environment
        interactions networks. The 'netgwas' package can deal with
        biparental inbreeding and outbreeding species with any ploidy
        level, namely diploid (2 sets of chromosomes), triploid (3 sets
        of chromosomes), tetraploid (4 sets of chromosomes) and so on.
        We target on high-dimensional data where number of variables p
        is considerably larger than number of sample sizes (p >> n).
        The computations is memory-optimized using the sparse matrix
        output. The 'netgwas' implements the methodological
        developments in Behrouzi and Wit (2017)
        <doi:10.1111/rssc.12287> and Behrouzi and Wit (2017)
