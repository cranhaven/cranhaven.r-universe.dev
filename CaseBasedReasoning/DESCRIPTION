Description: Case-based reasoning is a problem-solving methodology that
        involves solving a new problem by referring to the solution of
        a similar problem in a large set of previously solved problems.
        The key aspect of Case Based Reasoning is to determine the
        problem that "most closely" matches the new problem at hand.
        This is achieved by defining a family of distance functions and
        using these distance functions as parameters for local
        averaging regression estimates of the final result. The optimal
        distance function is chosen based on a specific error measure
        used in regression estimation. This approach allows for
        efficient problem-solving by leveraging past experiences and
        adapting solutions from similar cases. The underlying concept
        is inspired by the work of Dippon J. (2002)
