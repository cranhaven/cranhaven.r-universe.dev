Release 1.0.0 on Dec 11, 2013

This is the first version of aidar - a package for R to read AIDA files.
It features a full set of functions to get information about an AIDA file, retrieve an AIDA annotation, 1-, 2-, or 3-D histogram or cloud, 1- or 2-D profile histogram or tuple identified by the objects name from the file. Objects are typically returned as data.frame with their content mapped to the structure of the objects.
