# aidar - Reading AIDA files into R

This package allows to read histograms and tuples from <a href="http://aida.freehep.org/">AIDA</a> files.

The various objects from the file will be converted into R's dataframes. 


## Installing the development version of aidar from github:

(from <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9656016/how-to-install-development-version-of-r-packages-github-repository>)

	install.packages("devtools")
	library(devtools)
	
	dev_mode(on=T) # switch to development mode (if you want)
	install_github("aidar", username="apfeiffer1")
	library(aidar)
	
	# now you can use the aidar library - see the "examples of usage" below
	
	# when finished do:
	dev_mode(on=F)      # ... and you are back to having stable ggplot2
	
## Examples of usage

### Listing the content of a file

First use R's system tools to create the filename, for this example we use a gzip compressed XML file from the package:

	histoFile = system.file("inst", "data", "histos.xml.gz", package="aidar")

If you want to use your own file, do not use this method, but rather specify the path to your file:

	histoFile = "/path/to/my/files/histos.xml.gz"


We can list the content of the file via:

	info = getFileInfo(histoFile)
	print(info)

You can of course also use a string as a file name, e.g. to use the file "myHistos.xml.gz" from the current working directory in your R session, do:

	info = getFileInfo("myHistos.xml.gz")
	print(info)

### Getting the annotation (summary info) of an object

Now we can get the annotation of the object with the name "1" from the file:

	a1 = getAnnotation(histoFile, '1')
	
### Retrieve the content of a histogram (or other object) as a data.frame
	
And that's how we get the (content of the) 1D histogram named '1' in the file into a R data-frame:

	h1 = getHisto1D(histoFile, '1')
	
Similar for a tuple named '100' in the gzip-compressed XML file (this will take a few seconds):
	
	tupleFile = system.file("inst", "data", "tuple.xml.gz", package="aidar")
	aTup = getAnnotation(tupleFile, '100')
	
	t100 = getTuple(tupleFile, '100')
	
... and plot one of the tuple's columns:

 	plot(t100$sin)


## Full list of functions available in the package

The full list of methods available to retrieve AIDA objects and information about them are (replace `<histoFile>` and `<objectName>` with your values, as usual):

### Information

	info = getFileInfo( <histoFile> )

	ann = getAnnotation( <histoFile>, <objectName> )

### Retrieving objects as data.frames

	h1d = getHisto1D( <histoFile>, <objectName> )
	h2d = getHisto2D( <histoFile>, <objectName> )
	h3d = getHisto3D( <histoFile>, <objectName> )
    
	c1d = getCloud1D( <histoFile>, <objectName> )
	c2d = getCloud2D( <histoFile>, <objectName> )
	c3d = getCloud3D( <histoFile>, <objectName> )
    
	p1d = getProfile1D( <histoFile>, <objectName> )
	p2d = getProfile2D( <histoFile>, <objectName> )
    
	tup = getTuple( <histoFile>, <objectName> )
