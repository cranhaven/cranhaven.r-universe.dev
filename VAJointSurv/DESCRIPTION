Description: Estimates joint marker (longitudinal) and survival
        (time-to-event) outcomes using variational approximations. The
        package supports multivariate markers allowing for correlated
        error terms and multiple types of survival outcomes which may
        be left-truncated, right-censored, and recurrent. Time-varying
        fixed and random covariate effects are supported along with
        non-proportional hazards.
