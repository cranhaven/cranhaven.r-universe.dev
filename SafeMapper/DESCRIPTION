Description: Provides drop-in replacements for 'purrr' and 'furrr'
        mapping functions with built-in fault tolerance, automatic
        checkpointing, and seamless recovery capabilities. When
        long-running computations are interrupted due to errors, system
        crashes, or other failures, simply re-run the same code to
        automatically resume from the last checkpoint. Ideal for
        large-scale data processing, API calls, web scraping, and other
        time-intensive operations where reliability is critical. For
        'purrr' methodology, see Wickham and Henry (2023)
