Title: Derivative-Based Optimization with User-Defined Convergence
        Criteria
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Provides a derivative-based optimization framework that
        allows users to combine eight convergence criteria. Unlike
        standard optimization functions, this package includes a
        built-in mechanism to verify the positive definiteness of the
        Hessian matrix at the point of convergence. This additional
        check helps prevent the solver from falsely identifying
        non-optimal solutions, such as saddle points, as valid minima.
