Description: The 'Grouphmap' was implemented in R, an open-source
        programming environment, and was released under the provided
        website. The difference analysis is based on the 'limma'
        package, which can cover gene and protein expression profiles
        (Reference: Matthew E Ritchie , Belinda Phipson , Di Wu ,
        Yifang Hu , Charity W Law , Wei Shi , Gordon K Smyth (2015)
        <doi:10.1093/nar/gkv007>). The GO enrichment analysis is based
        on the 'clusterProfiler' package and supports three common
        species: human, mouse, and yeast (Reference: Guangchuang Yu,
        Li-Gen Wang, Yanyan Han, Qing-Yu He (2012)
        <doi:10.1089/omi.2011.0118>). The results of batch difference
        analysis and enrichment analysis are output in separate folders
        for easy viewing and further visualization of the results
        during the process. The results returned a heatmap in R and
        exported to 3 folders named DEG, go, and merge.
