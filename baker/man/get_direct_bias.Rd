\title{Obtain direct bias that measure the discrepancy of a posterior
distribution of pie and a true pie.}
\usage{
get_direct_bias(DIR_list, truth = NULL, silent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{DIR_list}{The list of  where Bayesian results are stored}

\item{truth}{True etiologic fraction vector (must sum to 1)  used to generate data;
Default is \code{NULL}. If a vector is supplied, then only the first path in \code{DIR_LIST}
is used.}

\item{silent}{Default is FALSE. To suppress printing messages, set to TRUE.}
}
\value{
a list of length two. \code{diff} is the direct differences;
\code{prb} is the percent relative bias.
}
