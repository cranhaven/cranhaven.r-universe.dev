Description: Implements Bayesian inference for the conditional genetic
        stock identification model.  It allows inference of mixed
        fisheries and also simulation of mixtures to predict accuracy.
        A full description of the underlying methods is available in a
        recently published article in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries
        and Aquatic Sciences: <doi:10.1139/cjfas-2018-0016>.
