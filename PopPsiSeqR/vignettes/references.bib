  abstract = {Finding the genes underlying complex traits is difficult. We show that new sequencing technology combined with traditional genetic techniques can efficiently identify genetic regions underlying a complex and quantitative behavioral trait. As a proof of concept we used phenotype-based introgression to backcross loci that control innate food preference in Drosophila simulans into the genomic background of D. sechellia, which expresses the opposite preference. We successfully mapped D. simulans introgression regions in a small mapping population (30 flies) with whole-genome resequencing using light coverage (∼1×). We found six loci contributing to D. simulans food preference, one of which overlaps a previously discovered allele. This approach is applicable to many systems, does not rely on laborious marker development or genotyping, does not require existing high quality reference genomes, and needs only small mapping populations. Because introgression is used, researchers can scale mapping population size, replication, and number of backcross generations to their needs. Finally, in contrast to more widely used mapping techniques like F(2) bulk-segregant analysis, our method produces near-isogenic lines that can be kept and reused indefinitely.},

abstract = {Interspecies hybrid sterility has been extensively studied, especially in the genus Drosophila. Hybrid sterility is more often found in the heterogametic (XY or ZW) sex, a trend called Haldane's rule. Although this phenomenon is pervasive, identification of a common genetic mechanism remains elusive, with modest support found for a range of potential theories. Here, we identify a single precise morphological phenotype, which we call 'needle-eye sperm', that is associated with hybrid sterility in three separate species pairs that span the Drosophila genus. The nature of the phenotype indicates a common point of meiotic failure in sterile hybrid males. We used 10 generations of backcross selection paired with whole-genome pooled sequencing to genetically map the regions underlying the needle-eye (NE) sperm phenotype. Surprisingly, the sterility phenotype was present in {\~{}}50{\%} of males even after 10 generations of backcrossing, and only a single region of the X chromosome was associated with sterility in one direction of backcross. Owing to the common phenotype among sterile male hybrids, and the strong effect of individual loci, further exploration of these findings may identify a universal mechanism for the evolution of hybrid sterility.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: The variant call format (VCF) is a generic format for storing DNA polymorphism data such as SNPs, insertions, deletions and structural variants, together with rich annotations. VCF is usually stored in a compressed manner and can be indexed for fast data retrieval of variants from a range of positions on the reference genome. The format was developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and has also been adopted by other projects such as UK10K, dbSNP and the NHLBI Exome Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements various utilities for processing VCF files, including validation, merging, comparing and also provides a general Perl API.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: http://vcftools.sourceforge.net},
