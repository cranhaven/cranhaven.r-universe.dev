Description: Handle data from evolve and resequence experiments.
        Measured allele frequencies (e.g., from variants called from
        high-throughput sequencing data) are compared using an update
        of the PsiSeq algorithm (Earley, Eric and Corbin Jones (2011)
        <doi:10.1534/genetics.111.129445>). Functions for saving and
        loading important files are also included, as well as functions
        for basic data visualization.
