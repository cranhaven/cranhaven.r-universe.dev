# bsitar 0.1.1


---

### New feature

- Added 'optimize_model' function to perform model optimization by fitting 
  model with varying degree of freedom and by transforming 'x' (predictor) 
  and 'y' (outcome) varibales. The allowed transformations for 'x' and 'y'    
  variables are 'log' (logarithmic) and 'sqrt' (square root) transformation. 
  The 'optimize_model' performs comparison of resulting model fits based on 
  user specified  criteria such as the Watanabe–Akaike information criterion
  ('waic'), leave-one-out cross-validation ('loo') and the Bayesian R square 
  ('bayes_R2'). Please see help file of 'optimize_model' to see documentation.

### Minor changes

- Updated documentation
- Added vignette about the Bayesian SITAR model fit to height data (univariate model)
- Added issue tracker url: https://github.com/Sandhu-SS/bsitar/issues


### Bugfixes

- plot_curves(): Fixed bug to remove warning "Duplicated aesthetics after name 
standardisation: group in when plotting together unadjusted and adjusted curves." 
- plot_curves(): Fixed bug to remove palettes error when tried plotting all 
four curves together (distance, velocity, adjusted and unadjusted)
- plot_curves(): and growthparameters() fixed issues relating to not using 
'dplyr::all_of()' when within the 'dplyr::select()'


### Miscellaneous
- Added more utility functions for internal use (for consistency and efficiency) 
- Minor corrections/changes to make R code more efficient and consistent across sub modules.
