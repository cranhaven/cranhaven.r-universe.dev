Description: It offers simplified access to Brazilian macroeconomic and
        financial indicators selected from official sources, such as
        the 'IBGE' (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics)
        via the 'SIDRA' API and the 'Central Bank of Brazil' via the
        'SGS' API. It allows users to quickly retrieve and visualize
        data series such as the unemployment rate and the Selic
        interest rate. This package was developed for data access and
        visualization purposes, without generating forecasts or
        statistical results. For more information, see the official
        APIs: <https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/> and
        <https://dadosabertos.bcb.gov.br/dataset/>.
