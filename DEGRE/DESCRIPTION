Description: Genes that are differentially expressed between two or
        more experimental conditions can be detected in RNA-Seq. A high
        biological variability may impact the discovery of these genes
        once it may be divergent between the fixed effects. However,
        this variability can be covered by the random effects. 'DEGRE'
        was designed to identify the differentially expressed genes
        considering fixed and random effects on individuals. These
        effects are identified earlier in the experimental design
        matrix. 'DEGRE' has the implementation of preprocessing
        procedures to clean the near zero gene reads in the count
        matrix, normalize by 'RLE' published in the 'DESeq2' package,
        'Love et al. (2014)' <doi:10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8> and it
        fits a regression for each gene using the Generalized Linear
        Mixed Model with the negative binomial distribution, followed
        by a Wald test to assess the regression coefficients.
