Description: Provides two different methods, linear and nonlinear, to
        interpolate a bivariate function, scalar-valued or
        vector-valued. The interpolated data are not necessarily
        gridded. The algorithms are performed by the 'C++' library
        'CGAL' (<https://www.cgal.org/>).
