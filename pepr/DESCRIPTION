Description: A PEP, or Portable Encapsulated Project, is a dataset that
        subscribes to the PEP structure for organizing metadata. It is
        written using a simple YAML + CSV format, it is your one-stop
        solution to metadata management across data analysis
        environments. This package reads this standardized project
        configuration structure into R. Described in Sheffield et al.
