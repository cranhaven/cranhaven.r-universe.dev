#' An R package supporting the selection of a suitable transformation
#' 
#' Estimation, selection and comparison of several families of
#' transformations. The families of transformations included in the package are 
#' the following: Bickel-Doksum, Box-Cox, Dual, Glog, Gpower, Log, Log-shift opt,
#' Manly, Modulus, Neglog, Reciprocal and Yeo-Johnson. The package simplifies to 
#' compare linear models with untransformed and transformed dependent variable 
#' as well as linear models where the dependent variable is transformed with 
#' different transformations. Furthermore, the package employs maximum likelihood 
#' approaches, skewness and divergence minimization to estimate the optimal 
#' transformation parameter.
