\description{
A case-population sample extracted from American Community Survey (ACS) 2018, restricted to white males residing in California with at least a bachelor's degree.
The original ACS dataset is not from case-population sampling, but this case-population sample is obtained by the following procedure.
The case sample is composed of 921 individuals whose income is top-coded.
The control sample of equal size is randomly drawn without replacement from all observations and its top-coded status is coded missing.
Age is restricted to be between 25 and 70.
