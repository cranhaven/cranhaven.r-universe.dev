Description: An adaptation of Kernelized Stein Discrepancy, this
        package provides a goodness-of-fit test of whether a given
        i.i.d. sample is drawn from a given distribution. It works for
        any distribution once its score function (the derivative of
        log-density) can be provided. This method is based on "A
        Kernelized Stein Discrepancy for Goodness-of-fit Tests and
        Model Evaluation" by Liu, Lee, and Jordan, available at
        <arXiv:1602.03253>.
