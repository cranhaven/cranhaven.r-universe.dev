Description: A logistic regression tree is a decision tree with
        logistic regressions at its leaves. A particular stochastic
        expectation maximization algorithm is used to draw a few good
        trees, that are then assessed via the user's criterion of
        choice among BIC / AIC / test set Gini. The formal development
        is given in a PhD chapter, see Ehrhardt (2019)
