Description: A statistical framework and computational procedure for
        identifying the sub-populations within a tumor, determining the
        mutation profiles of each subpopulation, and inferring the
        tumor's phylogenetic history. The input are variant allele
        frequencies (VAFs) of somatic single nucleotide alterations
        (SNAs) along with allele-specific coverage ratios between the
        tumor and matched normal sample for somatic copy number
        alterations (CNAs). These quantities can be directly taken from
        the output of existing software. Canopy provides a general
        mathematical framework for pooling data across samples and
        sites to infer the underlying parameters. For SNAs that fall
        within CNA regions, Canopy infers their temporal ordering and
        resolves their phase.  When there are multiple evolutionary
        configurations consistent with the data, Canopy outputs all
        configurations along with their confidence assessment.
