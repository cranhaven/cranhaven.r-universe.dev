Description: We innovatively defined a pathway mutation accumulate
        perturbation score (PMAPscore) to reflect the position and the
        cumulative effect of the genetic mutations at the pathway
        level. Based on the PMAPscore of pathways, identified
        prognosis-related pathways altered by somatic mutation and
        predict immunotherapy efficacy by constructing a
        multiple-pathway-based risk model (Tarca, Adi Laurentiu et al
        (2008) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btn577>).
