Description: Implements the dynamic logistic state space model for
        binary outcome data proposed by Jiang et al. (2021)
        <doi:10.1111/biom.13593>. It provides a computationally
        efficient way to update the prediction whenever new data
        becomes available. It allows for both time-varying and
        time-invariant coefficients, and use cubic smoothing splines to
        model varying coefficients. The smoothing parameters are
        objectively chosen by maximum likelihood. The model is updated
        using batch data accumulated at pre-specified time intervals.
