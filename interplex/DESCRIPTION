Description: Computational topology, which enables topological data
        analysis (TDA), makes pervasive use of abstract mathematical
        objects called simplicial complexes; see Edelsbrunner and Harer
        (2010) <doi:10.1090/mbk/069>. Several R packages and other
        software libraries used through an R interface construct and
        use data structures that represent simplicial complexes,
        including mathematical graphs viewed as 1-dimensional
        complexes. This package provides coercers (converters) between
        these data structures. Currently supported structures are
        complete lists of simplices as used by 'TDA'; the simplex trees
        of Boissonnat and Maria (2014) <doi:10.1007/s00453-014-9887-3>
        as implemented in 'simplextree' and in Python GUDHI (by way of
        'reticulate'); and the graph classes of 'igraph' and 'network',
        by way of the 'intergraph' package.
