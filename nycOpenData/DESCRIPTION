Description: Provides a unified set of helper functions to access
        datasets from the NYC Open Data platform
        <https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/>. Functions return results
        as tidy tibbles and support optional filtering, sorting, and
        row limits via the Socrata API. The package includes endpoints
        for 311 service requests, DOB job applications, juvenile
        justice metrics, school safety, environmental data, event
        permitting, and additional citywide datasets. The package is
        utilized as a primary pedagogical tool for teaching data
        acquisition in 'Reproducible Research Using R'.
