# nycOpenData 0.1.5

## New features and documentation

- Added a new vignette, *“Working with NYC 311 Data”*, demonstrating an end-to-end,
  reproducible workflow for accessing, filtering, and visualizing NYC 311 service
  requests using `nyc_311()`. The vignette is available on the package website and
  via `vignette("nyc-311", package = "nycOpenData")`.

- Updated `nyc_311()` to explicitly target the NYC 311 Service Requests dataset
  covering **2020–present**, aligning the function with the current primary NYC
  Open Data endpoint.

- Added a new function, `nyc_311_2010_2019()`, providing access to historical NYC
  311 service request data from **2010–2019**, which is maintained as a separate
  dataset on the NYC Open Data platform.

## Bug fixes and maintenance

- Continued improvements to internal request handling for reliability and
  consistency when interacting with live NYC Open Data APIs.

- Updated documentation and examples to ensure robust behavior during CRAN checks
  while preserving reproducible workflows for interactive use.

- No breaking changes to existing function interfaces.
