Description: The increasing popularity of geographically weighted (GW)
        techniques has resulted in the development of several R
        packages, such as 'GWmodel'. To facilitate their usages,
        'GWmodelVis' provides a 'shiny'-based interactive visualization
        toolkit for geographically weighted (GW) models. It includes a
        number of visualization tools, including dynamic mapping of
        parameter surfaces, statistical visualization, sonification and
        exporting videos via 'FFmpeg'.
