Description: A Bayesian hybrid approach for inferring Directed Acyclic
        Graphs (DAGs) for continuous, discrete, and mixed data. The
        algorithm can use the graph inferred by another more efficient
        graph inference method as input; the input graph may contain
        false edges or undirected edges but can help reduce the search
        space to a more manageable size. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte
        Carlo algorithm is then used to infer the probability of
        direction and absence for the edges in the network. References:
