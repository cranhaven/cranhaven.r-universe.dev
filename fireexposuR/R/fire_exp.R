#' Compute the wildfire exposure metric
#'
#' @description
#' `fire_exp()` returns a SpatRaster of wildfire exposure values calculated
#' using the input hazard fuel raster for a specified transmission distance.
#'
#' @details
#' This function is the primary function in this package, the output from this
#' function serves as the first input to all other functions in this package.
#'
#' ## Background
#'
#' Wildfire exposure was first proposed for community scale assessments by
#' Beverly et al. (2010). Wildfire entry points to the built environment were
#' identified by evaluating the surrounding wildland fuels as potential ignition
#' sources. These methods were adapted and validated by Beverly et al. (2021)
#' for landscape scale assessments. Visual aids to better understand these
#' concepts are available in the Wildfire Exposure Assessment Guidebook
#' (FireSmart Canada 2018) which includes intuitive illustrations.
#'
#' Three transmission distances were defined in Beverly et al. (2010) for
#' different scales of wildfire ignition processes. Different fuel types
#' are capable of transmitting fire at different scales. The transmission
#' distances define a potential maximum spread distance from an ignition
#' source. If the default distances do not accurately represent fire behaviour
#' in your area of interest you can adjust them with [fire_exp_adjust()].
#'
#' ### Radiant heat
#'
#' The default transmission distance for radiant heat is 30 meters. At this
#' scale of wildfire transmission wildfire can spread from direct flame contact
#' or thermal radiation warming of fuels.
#'
#' ### Ember spotting
#'
#' Embers (AKA firebrands) can be carried by wind beyond the active fire front.
#' To determin two different ember spreading distances Beverly et al. (2010)
#' reviewed fire-spot distance observations and applied predictive models to
#' verify these distances were a reasonable assumption.
#'
#' #### Short-range embers
#'
#' The default transmission distance for short-range embers is 100 meters. Some
#' fuel types have the potential to produce embers over short distances. An
#' example fuel type that has the potential to transmit short-range embers is
#' a deciduous forest. Fuels considered hazardous to short-range ember ignition
#' will also be hazardous to transmit fire via radiant heat or direct flame
#' contact.
#'
#' #### Long-range embers
#'
#' The default transmission distance for long-range embers is 500 meters.
#' Some fuel types have the potential to transmit embers across large distances.
#' This landscape scale process is often a contributor to large, fast-moving
#' fires. Any fuels that are considered hazardous for long-range ember spotting
#' could also transmit fire by short-range ember spotting and radiant heat. An
#' example fuel type that has the potential to transmit long-range embers is a
#' mature pine stand.
#'
#' Although it is possible for embers from certain fuel types to be carried
#' much farther than the defined 500 meter transmission distance under extreme
#' conditions, these cases are relatively uncommon.
#'
#' The 500 meter spread distance has been further validated across Alberta
#' (Beverly et al. 2021), in Alaska (Schmidt et al. 2024), across the entire
#' Canadian landbase (manuscript in preparation), and in Portugal (manuscript
#' in preparation).
#'
#' ## Technical
#'
#' ### How the metric is calculated
#'
#' The wildfire exposure metric is calculated for each cell individually using a
#' focal window of the surrounding cells within the specified transmission
#' distance. The proportion of cells within the assessment window that are
#' classed as hazardous is returned. The wildfire exposure metric has a range
#' of 0-1. A wildfire exposure value of 0.5 can be interpreted as 50% of cells
#' within the specified transmission distance area have the potential to
#' spread fire to the assessment cell. A value of 0.5 can also be interpreted
#' in the other direction, a fire in the assessment cell could potentially
#' spread to 50% of the surrounding cells within the specified transmission
#' distance.
#'
#' ### Input features
#'
#' An input hazard raster must be prepared by the user in accordance with the
#' intended use. First, refer to the Get Started vignette by running
#' `vignette("fireexposuR")` to determine what the data requirements are for
#' the intended application. Then refer to the Preparing Input Data vignette by
#' running `vignette("prep-input-data")` for lots of recommendations, advice,
#' and examples.
#'
#' A separate hazard raster should be prepared for each of the transmission
#' distances of interest. There are also minimum spatial resolution and extent
#' requirements for each transmission distances.
#'
#' Long-range embers:
#' -  minimum raster resolution is 150 meters
#' -  The dimensions of the data must be wider/taller than 1000 meters because
#' 500 meters of data will be lost along the perimeter due to edge effects
#'
#' Short-range embers:
#' -  minimum raster resolution is 33 meters
#' -  The dimensions of the data must be wider/taller than 200 meters because
#' 100 meters of data will be lost along the perimeter due to edge effects
#'
#' Radiant heat:
#' -  minimum raster resolution is 10 meters
#' -  The dimensions of the data must be wider/taller than 60 meters because
#' 30 meters of data will be lost along the perimeter due to edge effects
#'
#' ### Spatial Reference
#'
#' The exposure raster will be returned in the same CRS as the input hazard
#' layer. A crs must be defined if the outputs will be used in other functions
#' in this package.
