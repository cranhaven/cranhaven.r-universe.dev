Description: Advances in automated document classification has led to
        identifying massive numbers of clinical concepts from
        handwritten clinical notes. These high dimensional clinical
        concepts can serve as highly informative predictors in building
        classification algorithms for identifying patients with
        different clinical conditions, commonly referred to as patient
        phenotyping. However, from a planning perspective, it is
        critical to ensure that enough data is available for the
        phenotyping algorithm to obtain a desired classification
        performance. This challenge in sample size planning is further
        exacerbated by the high dimension of the feature space and the
        inherent imbalance of the response class. Currently available
        sample size planning methods can be categorized into: (i)
        model-based approaches that predict the sample size required
        for achieving a desired accuracy using a linear machine
        learning classifier and (ii) learning curve-based approaches
        (Figueroa et al. (2012) <doi:10.1186/1472-6947-12-8>) that fit
        an inverse power law curve to pilot data to extrapolate
        performance. We develop model-based approaches for imbalanced
        data with correlated features, deriving sample size formulas
        for performance metrics that are sensitive to class imbalance
        such as Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve
        (AUC) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). This is done
        using a two-step approach where we first perform feature
        selection using the innovated High Criticism thresholding
        method (Hall and Jin (2010) <doi:10.1214/09-AOS764>), then
        determine the sample size by optimizing the two performance
        metrics. Further, we develop software in the form of an R
        package named 'planningML' and an 'R' 'Shiny' app to facilitate
        the convenient implementation of the developed model-based
        approaches and learning curve approaches for imbalanced data.
        We apply our methods to the problem of phenotyping rare
        outcomes using the MIMIC-III electronic health record database.
        We show that our developed methods which relate training data
        size and performance on AUC and MCC, can predict the true or
        observed performance from linear ML classifiers such as LASSO
        and SVM at different training data sizes. Therefore, in
        high-dimensional classification analysis with imbalanced data
        and correlated features, our approach can efficiently and
        accurately determine the sample size needed for
        machine-learning based classification.
