Description: Circular genomic permutation approach uses genome wide
        association studies (GWAS) results to establish the
        significance of pathway/gene-set associations whilst accounting
        for genomic structure(Cabrera et al (2012)
        <doi:10.1534/g3.112.002618>). All single nucleotide
        polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GWAS are placed in a 'circular
        genome' according to their location. Then the complete set of
        SNP association p-values are permuted by rotation with respect
        to the SNPs' genomic locations. Two testing frameworks are
        available: permutations at the gene level, and permutations at
        the SNP level. The permutation at the gene level uses Fisher's
        combination test to calculate a single gene p-value, followed
        by the hypergeometric test. The SNP count methodology maps each
        SNP to pathways/gene-sets and calculates the proportion of SNPs
        for the real and the permutated datasets above a pre-defined
        threshold. Genomicper requires a matrix of GWAS association
        p-values and SNPs annotation to genes. Pathways can be obtained
        from within the package or can be provided by the user.
