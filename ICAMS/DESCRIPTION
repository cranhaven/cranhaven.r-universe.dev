Description: Analysis and visualization of experimentally elucidated
        mutational signatures -- the kind of analysis and visualization
        in Boot et al., "In-depth characterization of the cisplatin
        mutational signature in human cell lines and in esophageal and
        liver tumors", Genome Research 2018,
        <doi:10.1101/gr.230219.117> and "Characterization of
        colibactin-associated mutational signature in an Asian oral
        squamous cell carcinoma and in other mucosal tumor types",
        Genome Research 2020 <doi:10.1101/gr.255620.119>. 'ICAMS'
        stands for In-depth Characterization and Analysis of Mutational
        Signatures. 'ICAMS' has functions to read in variant call files
        (VCFs) and to collate the corresponding catalogs of mutational
        spectra and to analyze and plot catalogs of mutational spectra
        and signatures. Handles both "counts-based" and "density-based"
        (i.e. representation as mutations per megabase) mutational
        spectra or signatures.
