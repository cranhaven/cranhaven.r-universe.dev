Description: Tool for the development of multi-linear QSPR/QSAR models
        (Quantitative structure-property/activity relationship). Theses
        models are used in chemistry, biology and pharmacy to find a
        relationship between the structure of a molecule and its
        property (such as activity, toxicology but also physical
        properties). The various functions of this package allows:
        selection of descriptors based of variances, intercorrelation
        and user expertise; selection of the best multi-linear
        regression in terms of correlation and robustness; methods of
        internal validation (Leave-One-Out, Leave-Many-Out,
        Y-scrambling) and external using test sets.
