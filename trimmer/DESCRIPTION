Description: A lightweight toolkit to reduce the size of a list object.
        The object is minimized by recursively removing elements from
        the object one-by-one. The process is constrained by a
        reference function call specified by the user, where the target
        object is given as an argument. The procedure will not allow
        elements to be removed from the object, that will cause results
        from the function call to diverge from the function call with
        the original object.
