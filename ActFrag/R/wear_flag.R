#' @title Create Wear/Nonwear Flags
#' @description Determine during which time period, subject should wear the device.
#' It is preferable that user provide their own wear/non wear flag which should has the same dimension
#' as the activity data. This function provide wear/non wear flag based on time of day.
#'
#' @param count.data \code{data.frame} of dimension n*1442 containing the 1440 minute activity data for all n subject days.
#' The first two columns have to be ID and Day.
#'
#' @param start start time, a string in the format of 24hr, e.g. "05:00"; defaults to "05:00".
#' @param end end time, a string in the format of 24hr, e.g. "23:00"; defaults to "23:00"
#'
#'
#'
#' @return A \code{data.frame} with same dimension and column name as the \code{count.data}, with 0/1 as the elments
#' reprensting wear, nonwear respectively.

#' @export
#' @details Fragmentation metrics are usually defined when subject is awake. The \code{weartime} provide time periods on which those features should be extracted.
#' This can be also used as indication of wake/sleep.
