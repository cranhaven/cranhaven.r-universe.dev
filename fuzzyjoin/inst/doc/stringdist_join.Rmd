```

Often you find yourself with a set of words that you want to combine with a "dictionary"- it could be a literal dictionary (as in this case) or a domain-specific category system. But you want to allow for small differences in spelling or punctuation.

The fuzzyjoin package comes with a set of common misspellings ([from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines)):

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(fuzzyjoin)
data(misspellings)

misspellings
```

```{r words}
# use the dictionary of words from the qdapDictionaries package,
# which is based on the Nettalk corpus.
library(qdapDictionaries)
words <- tbl_df(DICTIONARY)

words
```

As an example, we'll pick 1000 of these words (you could try it on all of them though), and use `stringdist_inner_join` to join them against our dictionary.

```{r sub_misspellings}
set.seed(2016)
sub_misspellings <- misspellings %>%
  sample_n(1000)
```

```{r joined, dependson = c("words", "sub_misspellings")}
joined <- sub_misspellings %>%
  stringdist_inner_join(words, by = c(misspelling = "word"), max_dist = 1)
```

By default, `stringdist_inner_join` uses optimal string alignment (Damerau–Levenshtein distance), and we're setting a maximum distance of 1 for a join. Notice that they've been joined in cases where `misspelling` is close to (but not equal to) `word`:

```{r dependson = "joined"}
joined
```

Note that there are some redundancies; words that could be multiple items in the dictionary. These end up with one row per "guess" in the output. How many words did we classify?

```{r dependson = "joined"}
joined %>%
  count(misspelling, correct)
```

So we found a match in the dictionary for about half of the misspellings. In how many of the ones we classified did we get at least one of our guesses right?

```{r dependson = "joined"}
which_correct <- joined %>%
  group_by(misspelling, correct) %>%
  summarize(guesses = n(), one_correct = any(correct == word))

which_correct

# percentage of guesses getting at least one right
mean(which_correct$one_correct)

# number uniquely correct (out of the original 1000)
sum(which_correct$guesses == 1 & which_correct$one_correct)
```

Not bad.

Note that `stringdist_inner_join` is not the only function we can use. If we're interested in including the words that we *couldn't* classify, we could have used `stringdist_left_join`:

```{r left_joined, dependson = "misspellings"}
left_joined <- sub_misspellings %>%
  stringdist_left_join(words, by = c(misspelling = "word"), max_dist = 1)

left_joined

left_joined %>%
  filter(is.na(word))
```

(To get *just* the ones without matches immediately, we could have used `stringdist_anti_join`). If we increase our distance threshold, we'll increase the fraction with a correct guess, but also get more false positive guesses:

```{r left_joined2, dependson = "misspellings"}
left_joined2 <- sub_misspellings %>%
  stringdist_left_join(words, by = c(misspelling = "word"), max_dist = 2)

left_joined2

left_joined2 %>%
  filter(is.na(word))
```

Most of the missing words here simply aren't in our dictionary.

You can try other distance thresholds, other dictionaries, and other distance metrics (see [stringdist-metrics](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stringdist/versions/0.9.4.6/topics/stringdist-metrics) for more). This function is especially useful on a domain-specific dataset, such as free-form survey input that is likely to be close to one of a handful of responses.
