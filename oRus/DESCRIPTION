Description: A first implementation of automated parsing of user
        stories, when used to defined functional requirements for
        operational research mathematical models. It allows reading
        user stories, splitting them on the who-what-why template, and
        classifying them according to the parts of the mathematical
        model that they represent. Also provides semantic grouping of
        stories, for project management purposes.
