Title: K-Means for Joint Longitudinal Data
Description: An implementation of k-means specifically design to
        cluster joint trajectories (longitudinal data on several
        variable-trajectories). Like 'kml', it provides facilities to
        deal with missing value, compute several quality criterion
        (Calinski and Harabatz, Ray and Turie, Davies and Bouldin,
        BIC,...) and propose a graphical interface for choosing the
        'best' number of clusters. In addition, the 3D graph
        representing the mean joint-trajectories of each cluster can be
        exported through LaTeX in a 3D dynamic rotating PDF graph.
