# @description An x3p file contains a "surface matrix" whose elements represent
#   individual pixels of a breech face impression microscopy scan. The
#   dimension of the surface matrix indicates the width/depth (x,y, if viewed
#   from a top-down perspective) of the scan while the actual values of each
#   element of the surface matrix represent the height (z) of the breech face
#   at that observed (x,y) location. So a particular "voxel" is characterized
#   by its row/column index in the matrix along with the value of the matrix at
#   that particular row/column combination. An element of the surface matrix
#   may be NA if the scan did not detect the cartridge case at the particular
#   (x,y) location. For example, most of the values on the perimeter of the
#   surface matrix are typically NA because the scan itself is taken such that
#   the breech face impression is approximately centered in the scanning area
#   (i.e, there's a fair amount of breathing room between the actual breech
#   face impression and the edges of the scan). All of this introduction is to
#   explain that for a given row/col in the surface matrix we can add up the
#   number of non-NA pixels and use this as an indicator for where the breech
#   face impression sits in the image (e.g, the first row in which a non-NA
#   pixel occurs is likely the beginning of the top of the breech face
#   impression while the last row in which a non-NA pixel occurs is likely the
#   bottom of the breech face impression). While it's fairly easy to detect the
#   beginning/end of the breech face impression within the entire surface
#   matrix, our goal is to determine the location of the firing pin impression
#   circle in the surface matrix. The firing pin impression circle is typically
#   a large circle punched through the interior of the breech face impression
#   scan. The goal of the function below is to detect where the firing pin
#   circle begins/ends in the surface matrix by considering the non-NA pixel
#   counts per row (or col). The idea being that the two largest modes of this
#   row/col-wise pixel count sequence should be the beginning/end of the firing
#   pin impression circle. Identifying the distance between the two largest
#   modes is essentially all that the function below accomplishes. It is often
#   the case that a breech face impression scan has a few spotty missing values
#   within the interior of the breech face impression (electron microscpy isn't
#   perfect). As such, the row/col-wise non-NA pixel counts are not often a
#   smooth sequence. Thus, the zoo::roll_mean function is used to smooth-out
#   the non-NA pixel counts so that the trend in the counts (in particular, the
#   modes) can be differentiated from noise introduced by spotty missing
#   values. The size of the kernel used in the roll_mean function is
#   indicated by the nonNA_sum_smootherSize argument.

#   different rotations of the surface matrix (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75
#   degrees). Based on the argument passed to aggregationFunction, these 12

#   minimum was determined to be an effective aggregation function in
#   preliminary tests).
