Description: Implements state-of-the-art Random Graphical Models (RGMs)
        for multivariate data analysis across multiple environments,
        offering tools for exploring network interactions and
        structural relationships. Capabilities include joint inference
        across environments, integration of external covariates, and a
        Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification. Applicable
        in various fields, including microbiome analysis. Methods based
        on Vinciotti, V., Wit, E., & Richter, F. (2023). "Random
        Graphical Model of Microbiome Interactions in Related
        Environments." <arXiv:2304.01956>.
