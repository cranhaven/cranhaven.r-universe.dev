Description: Assessment of the prevalence of plastic debris in bird
        nests based on bootstrap replicates. The package allows for
        calculating bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for the
        estimated prevalence of debris. Combined with a Bayesian
        approach, the resampling simulations can be also used to define
        appropriate sample sizes to detect prevalence of plastics. The
        method has wide application, and can also be applied to
        estimate confidence intervals and define sample sizes for the
        prevalence of plastics ingested by any other organisms. The
        method is described in Tavares et al. (Submitted).
