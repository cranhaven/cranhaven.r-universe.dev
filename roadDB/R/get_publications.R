#' Get publication references from the ROAD database
#'
#' The \strong{\code{road_get_publications}} function retrieves publication 
#' references from the ROAD database. Entries are available in the \code{BibTex}
#' format or formatted according to bibliographic conventions, including books,
#' journal articles, book chapters, theses, and web pages.
#'
#' Use arguments to filter search results by location or output format, or omit
#' them to have a broader result set. All arguments are optional and should be
#' omitted or set to NULL when not used.
#'
#' @param localities specifies the subset of localities for which publications 
#' should be retrieved. This parameter can be a string (a single locality name), 
#' a vector of strings (multiple locality names), or a data frame containing a 
#' \code{locality_id} column (e.g., the output of \code{road_get_localities()}). 
#' Defaults to \code{NULL}.
#' @param bibtex specifies if publication references should be formatted as \code{BibTeX}.
#' Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#' 
#' @details With \code{localities = NULL} (the default), the function produces a 
#' complete list of all references compiled in ROAD, with each publication 
#' appearing only once. When \code{localities} is specified, duplicates may occur 
#' in the \code{Publication} column, if a single source provides information for 
#' multiple sites.
#' 
#' All parameters are optional. If not used, omit them or set them to NULL.
#'
#' @return A data frame with two columns:
#' @return \code{Locality}: Is only returned, if the argument \code{localities}
#' is populated.
#' @return \code{Publication}: Items from ROAD's publication table, formatted as
#' reference or \code{BibTex}.
