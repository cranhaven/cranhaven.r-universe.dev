#' Get an overview of categorical values in the ROAD database
#'
#' The `road_summarize_archaeology` function provides a quick overview of the
#' presence of a given search term across archaeology-related tables/attributes 
#' in the ROAD database and archaeology-related \code{road_get_*} functions in \code{roadDB}.
#' It queries all relevant functions and returns a list indicating whether 
#' each function contains the search term. This helps you identify the appropriate 
#' \code{road_get_*} functions for your search.
#' Once identified, you can apply these functions to retrieve the relevant assemblages.
#'
#' Background: The ROAD archaeology database is rich in categorical data, where 
#' archaeological findings are grouped according to their characteristics. These 
#' categories can be accessed using a variety of \code{road_get_*} functions, such as:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{road_get_lithic_typologies()}
#'   \item \code{road_get_lithic_raw_materials()}
#'   \item \code{road_get_organic_tools()}
#'   \item \code{road_get_symbolic_artifacts()}
#'   \item \code{road_get_features()}
#'   \item \code{road_get_miscellaneous_finds()}
#' }
#'
#' Some search terms may not be easily categorized, while others may appear 
#' across multiple categories depending on contextual interpretations. This 
#' function assists in identifying the most relevant categories for your search.
#'
#' @param term A string containing the search term (one item).
#'
#' @return Database search result as list.
#' @export
