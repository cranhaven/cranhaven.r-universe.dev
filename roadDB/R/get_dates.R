#' Retrieve dating information for assemblages, geological and archaeological layers from the ROAD Database
#'
#' The \strong{\code{road_get_dates}} function retrieves absolute dating records for 
#' assemblages, geological layers, and archaeological layers from the ROAD database. 
#' 
#' Use the argument to filter search results by assemblage or omit
#' it to have a broader result set. The argument is optional and should be
#' omitted or set to NULL when not used.
#' 
#' @param assemblages specifies a data frame with a subset of assemblages, for
#' which dating information should be retrieved. It must necessarily contain the
#' columns \code{locality_id} and \code{assemblage_id} (e.g., the output of 
#' \code{road_get_assemblages()}, or other functions with this level of detail).
#'
#' @details
#' The function is designed for users analyzing time series and allows for 
#' filtering results based on various criteria.
#'
#' @details
#' \strong{Background on Dating Context:}
#' Not all finds can be directly dated, either due to potential damage during
#' sampling or because the materials are unsuitable for absolute dating. In such
#' cases, the surrounding sediment or other objects—made from more suitable
#' materials—are dated and associated with the find. As a result, absolute dates
#' are stored in three different tables within ROAD:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item \code{geological_layer_age}: Dates from samples taken from geological layers.
#'    \item \code{archaeological_layer_age}: Dates from samples taken from archaeological layers.
#'    \item \code{assemblage_age}: Dates from samples taken directly from objects.
#'    }
#'
#' \strong{Background on multiple dates:} Multiple dates may be available for a
#' single object. For example, both the top and bottom of a stratigraphic unit 
#' may be sampled to bracket the age of a find. Different dating methods might 
#' also be used to obtain robust results, which can lead to varying age estimates. 
#' This is especially true when earlier dating methods are updated with more 
#' modern techniques. It is recommended to cross-check all results against 
#' relevant literature. 
#'
#' \strong{Background on aggregated ages:} The ROCEEH project has developed its 
#' own model to aggregate both absolute and relative dating methods to derive 
#' the variables \code{age_min} and \code{age_max}. These aggregated ages are 
#' not included in the \code{road_get_dates} function, which only returns raw data.
#'
#' \strong{Background on radiocarbon dating:} Please note that C14 dates are 
#' uncalibrated. For further analysis, use one of the available calibration 
#' tools, such as the \pkg{rcarbon} package available on CRAN 
#' (see: \url{https://cran.r-project.org/package=rcarbon}).
#'
#' All parameters are optional. If not used, omit them or set them to NULL.
#'
#' @return A data frame with absolute dating information. Rows represent individual dates, columns contain standard outputs and dating-related details on:
#' @return \code{age}: The attribute specifies the result of the dating analysis as reported by the laboratory in years before present (BP). Note that 14C dates are \strong{uncalibarated}.
#' @return \code{negative_standard_deviation} & \code{positive_standard_deviation}: The attributes specify the positive and negative standard deviation of the dating analysis in years.
#' @return \code{material_dated}: The attribute specifies the general type of material analyzed (e.g. bone, tooth, antler etc.).
#' @return \code{dating_method}: The attribute specifies the method of analysis (e.g. 14C, OSL, IRSL, etc.).
#' @return \code{laboratory_idlaboratory}: The attribute is the official abbreviation for the designated analytical laboratory.
#' @return \code{analysis_number}: The attribute specifies the official laboratory number 
#' assigned to the dated sample (e.g., Pta-2345, GrA-1234, OxA-X-2456-45). It always includes 
#' the lab prefix, followed by a single hyphen, and then the official number provided by the laboratory. 
#' @return \code{date_of_analysis}: The attribute specifies the year of the analysis/report 
#' or the first publication of the results in the format yyyy.
#' @return \code{id}: The attribute is automatically generated, sequential number. This number is unique for each age table.
#' @return \code{publication}: The attribute is a list of publications describing the respective geological stratigraphy.
