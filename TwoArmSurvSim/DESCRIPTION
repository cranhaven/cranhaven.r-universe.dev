Description: A system to simulate clinical trials with time to event
        endpoints. Event simulation is based on Cox models allowing for
        covariates in addition to the treatment or group factor.
        Specific drop-out rates (separate from administrative
        censoring) can be controlled in the simulation. Other features
        include stratified randomization, non-proportional hazards,
        different accrual patterns, and event projection (timing to
        reach the target event) based on interim data.
