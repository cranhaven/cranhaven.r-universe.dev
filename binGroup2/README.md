The goal of binGroup2 is to provide methods for the group testing
identification and estimation problems. Methods for the group testing
identification problem: 1) Operating characteristics (e.g., expected
number of tests) for commonly used hierarchical and array-based
algorithms, and 2) Optimal testing configurations for these same
algorithms. Methods for the group testing estimation problem: 1)
Estimation and inference procedures for an overall prevalence, and 2)
Regression modeling for commonly used hierarchical and array-based
algorithms.
