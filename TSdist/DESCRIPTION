Description: A set of commonly used distance measures and some
        additional functions which, although initially not designed for
        this purpose, can be used to measure the dissimilarity between
        time series. These measures can be used to perform clustering,
        classification or other data mining tasks which require the
        definition of a distance measure between time series. U. Mori,
        A. Mendiburu and J.A. Lozano (2016),
