Description: A network-guided penalized regression framework that
        integrates network characteristics from Gaussian graphical
        models with partial penalization, accounting for both network
        structure (hubs and non-hubs) and clinical covariates in
        high-dimensional omics data, including transcriptomics and
        proteomics. The full methodological details can be found in our
        recent preprint by Ahn S and Oh EJ (2025)
        <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2505.22986>.
