Description: An implementation of several machine learning algorithms
        for multivariate time series. The package includes functions
        allowing the execution of clustering, classification or outlier
        detection methods, among others. It also incorporates a
        collection of multivariate time series datasets which can be
        used to analyse the performance of new proposed algorithms.
        Some of these datasets are stored in GitHub data packages
        'ueadata1' to 'ueadata8'. To access these data packages, run
        'install.packages(c('ueadata1', 'ueadata2', 'ueadata3',
        'ueadata4', 'ueadata5', 'ueadata6', 'ueadata7', 'ueadata8'),
        repos='<https://anloor7.github.io/drat/>')'. The installation
        takes a couple of minutes but we strongly encourage the users
        to do it if they want to have available all datasets of mlmts.
        Practitioners from a broad variety of fields could benefit from
        the general framework provided by 'mlmts'.
