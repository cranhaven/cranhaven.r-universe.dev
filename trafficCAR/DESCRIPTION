Description: Tools for simulating and modeling traffic flow on road
        networks using spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) models.
        The package represents road systems as graphs derived from
        'OpenStreetMap' data <https://www.openstreetmap.org/> and
        supports network-based spatial dependence, basic preprocessing,
        and visualization for spatial traffic analysis.
