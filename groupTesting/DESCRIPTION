Description: Provides an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm using
        the approach introduced in Warasi (2023)
        <doi:10.1080/03610918.2021.2009867>. The EM algorithm can be
        used to estimate the prevalence (overall proportion) of a
        disease and to estimate a binary regression model from among
        the class of generalized linear models based on group testing
        data. The estimation framework we consider offers a flexible
        and general approach; i.e., its application is not limited to
        any specific group testing protocol. Consequently, the EM
        algorithm can model data arising from simple pooling as well as
        advanced pooling such as hierarchical testing, array testing,
        and quality control pooling. Also, provided are functions that
        can be used to conduct the Wald tests described in Buse (1982)
        <doi:10.1080/00031305.1982.10482817> and to simulate the group
        testing data described in Kim et al. (2007)
        <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2007.00817.x>. We offer a function to
        compute relative efficiency measures, which can be used to
        optimize the maximum likelihood estimator of disease
        prevalence.
