Description: Analysis of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Biolayer
        Interferometry data, with automations for high-throughput SPR.
        This version of the package fits the 1: 1 binding model, with
        and without bulkshift. It offers optional local or global Rmax
        fitting. The user must provide a sample sheet and a Carterra
        output file in Carterra's current format. There is a utility
        function to convert from Carterra's old output format. The user
        may run a custom pipeline or use the provided 'Runscript',
        which will produce a pdf file containing fitted Rmax, ka, kd
        and standard errors, a plot of the sensorgram and fits, and a
        plot of residuals. The script will also produce a .csv file
        with all of the relevant parameters for each spot on the SPR
        chip.
