Description: Probability mass (d), distribution (p), quantile (q), and
        random number generating (r and rt) functions for the
        time-varying right-truncated geometric (tvgeom) distribution.
        Also provided are functions to calculate the first and second
        central moments of the distribution. The tvgeom distribution is
        similar to the geometric distribution, but the probability of
        success is allowed to vary at each time step, and there are a
        limited number of trials. This distribution is essentially a
        Markov chain, and it is useful for modeling Markov chain
        systems with a set number of time steps.
