Description: Provides R bindings to the 'Automerge' Conflict-free
        Replicated Data Type ('CRDT') library. 'Automerge' enables
        automatic merging of concurrent changes without conflicts,
        making it ideal for distributed systems, collaborative
        applications, and offline-first architectures. The approach of
        local-first software was proposed in Kleppmann, M., Wiggins,
        A., van Hardenberg, P., McGranaghan, M. (2019)
        <doi:10.1145/3359591.3359737>. This package supports all
        'Automerge' data types (maps, lists, text, counters) and
        provides both low-level and high-level synchronization
        protocols for seamless interoperability with 'JavaScript' and
        other 'Automerge' implementations.
