\description{
Creates a text object for collaborative character-level editing.
Unlike regular strings (which use last-write-wins semantics),
text objects support character-level CRDT merging of concurrent edits,
cursor stability, and marks/formatting.
}
\details{
Use text objects for collaborative document editing. Use regular strings
for metadata, labels, and IDs (99\\% of cases).
}
\examples{
# Empty text object
am_text()

# Text with initial content
am_text("Hello, World!")

}
