\title{Split a dataset imported from Redcap into convenient subsets}
\usage{
split_redcap_dataset(dat, id_name = "patid")
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{a \code{tibble} produced by \code{\link{read_redcap_formatted}}.}

\item{id_name}{(character) the name of the subject ID variable.}
}
\value{

This function seperates a datasets into three parts: "Singular" data, which is the

\examples{
path_to_redcap_script <- system.file("examples", "testredcap.r", package = "DescrTab2")
dat <- read_redcap_formatted(path_to_redcap_script)
d <- split_redcap_dataset(dat, guess_ID_variable(dat, TRUE))
