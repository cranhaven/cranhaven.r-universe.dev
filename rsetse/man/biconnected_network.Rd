\title{A simple network made of three bi-connected components}
\format{
An igraph network with 7 nodes and 19 edges which forms three biconnected components:
\describe{
  \item{edge_name}{The name of the edge connecting the two vertices}
  \item{weight}{The edge weight connecting the two vertices. This value is 1000 for edges connecting nodes
  A to D, it is 500 for edges connecting nodes E to G, it is 100 connecting nodes D and E}
  \item{force}{The force produced by each node. It was calculated by subtracting the mean node centrality for the network
  from the node centrality}
  \item{group}{The group each node is in. This can be used to generate force if required}
}
}
\usage{
biconnected_network
}
\description{
The data set can be used to explore simple different embeddings methods on a very simple graph
