Description: An R implementation for the Strain Elevation and Tension
        embedding algorithm from Bourne (2020)
        <doi:10.1007/s41109-020-00329-4>. The package embeds graphs and
        networks using the Strain Elevation and Tension embedding
        (SETSe) algorithm. SETSe represents the network as a physical
        system, where edges are elastic, and nodes exert a force either
        up or down based on node features. SETSe positions the nodes
        vertically such that the tension in the edges of a node is
        equal and opposite to the force it exerts for all nodes in the
        network. The resultant structure can then be analysed by
        looking at the node elevation and the edge strain and tension.
        This algorithm works on weighted and unweighted networks as
        well as networks with or without explicit node features.  Edge
        elasticity can be created from existing edge weights or kept as
        a constant.
