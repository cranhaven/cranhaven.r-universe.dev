Description: Implements approximation methods for natural capital asset
        prices suggested by Fenichel and Abbott (2014)
        <doi:10.1086/676034> in Journal of the Associations of
        Environmental and Resource Economists (JAERE), Fenichel et al.
        (2016) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1513779113> in Proceedings of the
        National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and Yun et al. (2017) in
        PNAS (accepted), and their extensions: creating Chebyshev
        polynomial nodes and grids, calculating basis of Chebyshev
        polynomials, approximation and their simulations for:
        V-approximation (single and multiple stocks, PNAS),
        P-approximation (single stock, PNAS), and Pdot-approximation
        (single stock, JAERE). Development of this package was
