Description: Performs mutational signature analysis for targeted
        sequenced tumors. Unlike the canonical analysis of mutational
        signatures, SATS factorizes the mutation counts matrix into a
        panel context matrix (measuring the size of the targeted
        sequenced genome for each tumor in the unit of million base
        pairs (Mb)), a signature profile matrix, and a signature
        activity matrix. SATS also calculates the expected number of
        mutations attributed by a signature, namely signature burden,
        for each targeted sequenced tumor. For more details see Lee et
        al. (2024) <doi:10.1101/2023.05.18.23290188>.
