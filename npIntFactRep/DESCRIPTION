Description: Returns nonparametric aligned rank tests for the
        interaction in two-way factorial designs, on R data sets with
        repeated measures in 'wide' format. Five ANOVAs tables are
        reported. A PARAMETRIC one on the original data, one for a
        CHECK upon the interaction alignments, and three aligned rank
        tests: one on the aligned REGULAR, one on the FRIEDMAN, and one
        on the KOCH ranks. In these rank tests, only the resulting
        values for the interaction are relevant.
