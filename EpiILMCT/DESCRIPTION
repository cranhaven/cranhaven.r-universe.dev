Description: Provides tools for simulating from continuous-time
        individual level models of disease transmission, and carrying
        out infectious disease data analyses with the same models. The
        epidemic models considered are distance-based and/or contact
        network-based models within Susceptible-Infectious-Removed
        (SIR) or Susceptible-Infectious-Notified-Removed (SINR)
        compartmental frameworks. <doi:10.18637/jss.v098.i10>.
