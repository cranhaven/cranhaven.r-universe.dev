Description: We develop a new class of distribution free multiple
        testing rules for false discovery rate (FDR) control under
        general dependence. A key element in our proposal is a
        symmetrized data aggregation (SDA) approach to incorporating
        the dependence structure via sample splitting, data screening
        and information pooling. The proposed SDA filter first
        constructs a sequence of ranking statistics that fulfill global
        symmetry properties, and then chooses a data driven threshold
        along the ranking to control the FDR. For more information, see
        the website below and the accompanying paper: Du et al. (2020),
        "False Discovery Rate Control Under General Dependence By
        Symmetrized Data Aggregation", <arXiv:2002.11992>.
