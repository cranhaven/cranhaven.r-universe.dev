Description: Transfer learning, aiming to use auxiliary domains to help
        improve learning of the target domain of interest when multiple
        heterogeneous datasets are available, has been a hot topic in
        statistical machine learning. The recent transfer learning
        methods with statistical guarantees mainly focus on the overall
        parameter transfer for supervised models in the ideal case with
        the informative auxiliary domains with overall similarity. In
        contrast, transfer learning for unsupervised graph learning is
        in its infancy and largely follows the idea of overall
        parameter transfer as for supervised learning. In this package,
        the transfer learning for several complex graphical models is
        implemented, including Tensor Gaussian graphical models,
        non-Gaussian directed acyclic graph (DAG), and Gaussian
        graphical mixture models. Notably, this package promotes local
        transfer at node-level and subgroup-level in DAG structural
        learning and Gaussian graphical mixture models, respectively,
        which are more flexible and robust than the existing overall
        parameter transfer. As by-products, transfer learning for
        undirected graphical model (precision matrix) via D-trace loss,
        transfer learning for mean vector estimation, and single
        non-Gaussian learning via topological layer method are also
        included in this package. Moreover, the aggregation of
        auxiliary information is an important issue in transfer
        learning, and this package provides multiple user-friendly
        aggregation methods, including sample weighting, similarity
        weighting, and most informative selection. (Note: the transfer
        for tensor GGM has been temporarily removed in the current
        version as its dependent R package Tlasso has been archived.
