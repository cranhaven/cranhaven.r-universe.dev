Description: It provides an effective, efficient, and fast way to
        explore the Gene Ontology (GO). Given a set of genes, the
        package contains functions to assess the GO and obtain the
        terms associated with the genes and the levels of the GO terms.
        The package provides functions for the three different GO
        ontology. We discussed the methods explicitly in the following
        article <doi:10.1038/s41598-020-73326-3>.
