Description: The functions sp() and sp_seq() compute the support points
        in Mak and Joseph (2018) <DOI:10.1214/17-AOS1629>. Support
        points can be used as a representative sample of a desired
        distribution, or a representative reduction of a big dataset
        (e.g., an "optimal" thinning of Markov-chain Monte Carlo sample
        chains). This work was supported by USARO grant
        W911NF-14-1-0024 and NSF DMS grant 1712642.
