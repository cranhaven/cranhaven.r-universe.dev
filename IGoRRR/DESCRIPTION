Description: Launches a shiny application generating code to view
        tables in several ways, import/export tables, modify tables,
        make some basic graphics. 'IGoR' is a graphic user interface
        designed to help beginners using simple functions around table
        management and exploration. Inspired by 'Rcmdr', 'IGoR' is a
        code generator that, with simple inputs under a Shiny
        application, provides R code mainly built around the
        'tidyverse' or some packages in the direct line of the Mosaic
        project: the 'rio' and 'ggformula' packages. The generated code
        doesn't depend on IGoR and can be manually modified by the user
        or copied elsewhere.
