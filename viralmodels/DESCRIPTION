Description: Provides a comprehensive framework for building,
        evaluating, and visualizing regression models for analyzing
        viral load and CD4 (Cluster of Differentiation 4) lymphocytes
        data. It leverages the principles of the tidymodels ecosystem
        of Max Kuhn and Hadley Wickham (2020)
        <https://www.tidymodels.org> to offer a user-friendly
        experience in model development. This package includes
        functions for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model
        training, tuning, and evaluation, along with visualization
        tools to enhance the interpretation of model results. It is
        specifically designed for researchers in biostatistics,
        computational biology, and HIV research who aim to perform
        reproducible and rigorous analyses to gain insights into
        disease dynamics. The main focus is on improving the
        understanding of the relationships between viral load, CD4
        lymphocytes, and other relevant covariates to contribute to HIV
        research and the visibility of vulnerable seropositive
        populations.
