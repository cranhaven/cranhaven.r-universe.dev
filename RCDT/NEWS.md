# RCDT 1.1.0 (2022-04-06)

* New example to show that the triangulation depends on the order of the points.

* Now the output of `delaunay` contains a 'rgl' mesh object.

* Now the `plotDelaunay` function differentiates the border edges and the 
constraint edges.

* New feature: elevated Delaunay triangulation (or 2.5D Delaunay triangulation).
