Description: Methods for anonymisation of spatial datasets while
        preserving spatial structure and relationships. Original
        coordinates or raster geometries are transformed using
        randomized or predefined vertical shifts, horizontal shifts,
        and rotations. Compatible with point-based data in 'matrix',
        'data.frame', or 'sf' formats, as well as 'terra' raster
        objects. Supports reversible anonymisation workflows,
        hash-based validation, shapefile export, and consistent
        tangling across related datasets using stored transformation
        sequences. Approach informed by the De-Identification Decision
        Making Framework (CM O’Keefe, S Otorepec, M Elliot, E Mackey,
        and K O’Hara 2017) <doi:10.4225/08/59c169433efd4>.
