\title{Function to fill-in a Cholesky matrix}
\usage{
fillLprec(L, lfi)
}
\arguments{
\item{L}{matrix as the lower triangle
containing the Cholesky decomposition of
a initial precision matrix whose non-zeros are
only at the position where the lower triangle
side of the precision matrix is also non-zero}

\item{lfi}{integer vector used as indicator of the
position in the lower matrix where are the
fill-in elements. Must be col then row ordered.}
}
\value{
lower triangular matrix with the filled-in
elements thus \code{Q0} can be computed.
}
