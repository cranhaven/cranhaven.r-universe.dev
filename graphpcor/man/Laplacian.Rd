\description{
The (symmetric) Laplacian of a graph is a
square matrix with dimention
equal the number of nodes.
It is defined as
\deqn{L_{ij} = n_i \textrm{ if } i=j, -1 \textrm{ if } i\sim j, 0 \textrm{ otherwise}}{%
      Lij = ni if i=j, -1 if i~j or 0 otherwise}
where i~j means that there is an edge
between nodes i and j and
n_i is the number of edges including node i.
