\title{Compute the KLD between two multivariate Gaussian
distributions, assuming equal mean vector}
\usage{
KLD10(C1, C0, L1, L0)
}
\arguments{
\item{C1}{is a correlation matrix.}

\item{C0}{is a correlation matrix of the base model.}

\item{L1}{is the Cholesky of \code{C1}.}

\item{L0}{is the Cholesky of \code{C0}.}
}
\description{
Compute the KLD between two multivariate Gaussian
distributions, assuming equal mean vector
}
\details{
By assuming equal mean vector we have
\deqn{KLD = 0.5( tr(C0^{-1}C1) -p - log(|C1|) + log(|C0|) )}
}
