Description: Implement some models for correlation/covariance matrices
        including two approaches to model correlation matrices from a
        graphical structure. One use latent parent variables as
        proposed in Sterrantino et. al. (2024)
        <doi:10.1007/s10260-025-00788-y>. The other uses a graph to
        specify conditional relations between the variables. The
        graphical structure makes correlation matrices interpretable
        and avoids the quadratic increase of parameters as a function
        of the dimension. In the first approach a natural sequence of
        simpler models along with a complexity penalization is used.
        The second penalizes deviations from a base model. These can be
        used as prior for model parameters, considering C code through
        the 'cgeneric' interface for the 'INLA' package
        (<https://www.r-inla.org>). This allows one to use these models
        as building blocks combined and to other latent Gaussian models
        in order to build complex data models.
