\item{par.exp}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the parameter expansion technique of Liu & Wiu (1999) with a Haar prior is employed for updating the regression coefficients (\eqn{\beta_{wj}}) in the prevalence model. Experimental: tests suggest that it does not improve convergence or reduce autocorrelation.}

\item{collapsed.g}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the latent prevalence class membership update in the Gibbs sampler is integrated (collapsed) over the latent incidence time variable. This setting is recommended to improve convergence.}

\description{
Estimates the Pattern Mixture model of Klausch et al. (2025) using a Bayesian Gibbs sampler. The model is formulated as an interval-censored survival model over successive intervals, with the possibility of missed events due to imperfect test sensitivity. In addition, baseline tests at time zero may fail to detect pre-study events (prevalence).
}
\details{
This Bayesian prevalence-incidence mixture model (PIM) characterizes the time to incidence using an accelerated failure time (AFT) model of the form:

\deqn{\log(x_i) = \bm{z}_{xi}' \bm{\beta}_x + \sigma \epsilon_i}{log(x_i) = z_{xi}' beta_x + sigma * epsilon_i}

where \eqn{\epsilon_i} is chosen such that \eqn{x_i} follows a \code{weibull}, \code{lognormal}, or \code{loglog} (log-logistic) distribution, as specified by the \code{dist} argument. The covariate vector \eqn{\bm{z}_{xi}} for individual \eqn{i} is provided in the \code{Z.X} matrix.

Baseline prevalence is modeled using a probit formulation \eqn{Pr(g_i=1 | \bm{z}_{wi}) = Pr(w_i > 0 | \bm{z}_{wi})} with

\deqn{w_i = \bm{z}_{wi}' \bm{\beta}_w + \psi_i}{w_i = z_{wi}' beta_w + psi_i}

where \eqn{\psi_i} follows a standard normal distribution, and the covariate vector \eqn{\bm{z}_{wi}} is given in the \code{Z.W} matrix. The latent variable \eqn{w_i} determines prevalence status, such that \eqn{g_i = 1} if \eqn{w_i > 0} and \eqn{g_i = 0} otherwise.

The argument \code{Vobs} provides the observed testing times for all individuals. It is a list of numeric vectors, where each vector starts with \code{0} (representing the baseline time) and is followed by one or more screening times. The final entry is \code{Inf} in the case of right censoring or indicates the time of a positive test if an event is observed. Specifically:
\itemize{
\item If the baseline test is positive, the vector consists solely of \code{c(0)}.
\item If the baseline test is negative and right censoring occurs before the first regular screening, the vector is \code{c(0, Inf)}.
\item Otherwise, the vector ends with \code{Inf} in the case of right censoring (e.g., \code{c(0, 1, 3, 6, Inf)}) or ends at the event time (e.g., \code{c(0, 1, 3, 6)} for an event detected at time \code{6}).
}

By convention, every vector in \code{Vobs} starts with \code{0}. However, the binary vector \code{r} of \code{length} \eqn{n} indicates whether the baseline test was conducted (\code{r[i] = 1}) or missing (\code{r[i] = 0}) for each individual \code{i} in \code{Vobs}. For further details on coding, see Section 2 of the main paper.

Test sensitivity can be fixed to a value \code{kappa} by setting \code{update.kappa = FALSE}, or it can be estimated if \code{update.kappa = TRUE}. When estimated, a Beta prior is used, centered on the first element of \code{kappa.prior}, with a standard deviation equal to its second element. An internal optimization process finds the Beta prior hyperparameters that best match this choice. If the chosen prior is not feasible, unexpected behavior may occur. If \code{kappa.prior} is not specified (the default), an uninformative uniform(0,1) prior is used. In general, we advise against using an uninformative prior, but this default avoids favoring any specific informative prior.

The Gibbs sampler runs for \code{ndraws} iterations for each of \code{chains} total chains. The Metropolis step used for sampling the parameters of the incidence model applies a normal proposal (jumping) distribution with a standard deviation \code{prop.sd.X}, which must be selected by trial and error. An optimal acceptance rate is approximately 23\%, which can be computed per MCMC run from the model output. Alternatively, the function \link{search.prop.sd} provides a heuristic for selecting an effective proposal distribution standard deviation.

If \code{parallel = TRUE}, the Gibbs sampler runs in parallel with one chain per CPU (if possible), using the \code{foreach} package. If this package causes issues on some operating systems, set \code{parallel = FALSE} or use the \link{bayes.2S_seq} function, which iterates over \code{1:chains} using a \code{for} loop. This sequential function may also be useful in Monte Carlo simulations that parallelize experimental replications using \code{foreach}.

We recommend running at least two chains in parallel, and preferably more, to facilitate standard MCMC diagnostics such as the Gelman-Rubin \eqn{R} statistic. Additionally, we suggest first running the sampler for a moderate number of iterations to assess its behavior before using the updating functionality in \code{prev.run} to extend sampling (see below).

The option \code{update.till.convergence = TRUE} allows \code{bayes.2S} to run until convergence. Convergence is achieved when \eqn{R < 1.1} for all parameters and the minimum effective sample size \code{min_effs} is reached. The sampler continues updating until convergence is attained or \code{maxit} is reached.

The priors for the regression coefficients in the prevalence and incidence models can be controlled using \code{beta.prior}, \code{beta.prior.X}, \code{sig.prior.X}, and \code{tau.w}. Specifically:
\itemize{
\item \code{beta.prior} determines the prior type for \eqn{\beta_{xj}} (either \code{normal} or Student-\eqn{t} \code{t}).
\item \code{beta.prior.X} specifies either the standard deviation (for normal priors) or degrees of freedom (for Student-\eqn{t} priors). The default is a standard normal prior.
\item A half-normal prior is used for \eqn{\sigma}, with \code{sig.prior.X} controlling the standard deviation.
\item A zero-centered normal prior is assigned to \eqn{\beta_{wj}}, with \code{tau.w} controlling its standard deviation (default: standard normal).
}

Sometimes model fitting can be improved by fixing the \eqn{\sigma} parameter to a value, which is achieved through setting \code{fix.sigma.X = TRUE}. Then, the value specified as \code{sig.prior.X} is regarded as the correct value for \eqn{\sigma}, akin to a point prior on this value. The functionality can also be used to obtain the exponential distribution, aking to a Markov model. For this choose \code{dist='weibull'}, \code{sig.prior.X = 1}, and \code{fix.sigma.X=TRUE}.

The \code{prev.run} argument allows updating a previous run with additional MCMC draws. The MCMC chain resumes from the last draws, continues, and merges with the original run. If an initial model was fit using \code{mod <- bayes.2S(...)}, it can be updated using \code{mod_update <- bayes.2S(prev.run = mod)}. By default, \code{ndraws} additional iterations are added unless otherwise specified via \code{ndraws.update}. When updating, the number of discarded burn-in draws can be adjusted to half of the total draws (\code{update.burnin = TRUE}) or remain at the initial number (\code{update.burnin = FALSE}).

The Gibbs sampler requires starting values, which are obtained from an initial Bayesian interval-censored survival model using the specified \code{dist} distribution. The jumping distribution variance and the number of MCMC draws for this initialization are controlled via \code{ndraws.naive} and \code{naive.run.prop.sd.X}. The default values typically suffice but may need adjustment if initialization fails (e.g., increasing \code{ndraws.naive} or tuning \code{naive.run.prop.sd.X}). If starting values are found but still lead to an infinite posterior at initialization, the error "Bad starting values" is returned. Then it usually sufficces to re-run \code{bayes.2S} with an increased \code{ndraws.naive} value.
