Description: Snow profiles describe the vertical (1D) stratigraphy of
        layered snow with different layer characteristics, such as
        grain type, hardness, deposition date, and many more. Hence,
        they represent a data format similar to multivariate time
        series containing categorical, ordinal, and numerical data
        types. Use this package to align snow profiles by matching
        their individual layers based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).
        The aligned profiles can then be assessed with an independent,
        global similarity measure that is geared towards avalanche
        hazard assessment. Finally, through exploiting data aggregation
        and clustering methods, the similarity measure provides the
        foundation for grouping and summarizing snow profiles according
        to similar hazard conditions. In particular, this package
        allows for averaging large numbers of snow profiles with DTW
        Barycenter Averaging and thereby facilitates the computation of
        individual layer distributions and summary statistics that are
        relevant for avalanche forecasting purposes. For more
