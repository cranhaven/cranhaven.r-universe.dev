Description: Here we provide tools for the computation and
        factorization of high-dimensional tensor products that are
        formed by smaller matrices. The methods are based on properties
        of Kronecker products (Searle 1982, p. 265, ISBN-10:
        0470009616). We evaluated this methodology by benchmark testing
        and illustrated its use in Gaussian Linear Models ('Lopez-Cruz
        et al., 2024') <doi:10.1093/g3journal/jkae001>.
