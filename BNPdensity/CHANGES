	* DESCRIPTION (Version, Date): Release 2020-02-XX

  Improvements in code organisation and user interface.

	* Re-wrote the help to showcase "plot"" and other new S3 methods.

	* Various improvements to the doc and the README file

	* Changed interface for distribution names to use characters instead of integers, i.e. use "norm", "gamma" instead of "1", "2". Preserved backwards compatibility.

	* Cleaned the namespace of some functions

	* Removed two classes to reduce code duplication

	* Changed the names of some arguments that differed only in the capitalization (BREAKING).

	* DESCRIPTION (Version, Date): Release 2019.09.18

	Some of the code was not portable to Windows due to the use of mclapply functions. Several flags were added to make sure all functions can now run on Windows systems.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version, Date): Release 2019.09.11

	Many changes in put in place for the revision to the Journal of Statistical Software.

	* Use S3 paradigm to add plot, summary and print methods to the fit objects.

	* change convert_to_mcmc to as.mcmc to provide a more standard interfacing with the R package coda

	* renamed plot_GOF to GOFplots which is more similar to "Goodness of fit plots"

	* Extensive spell checking to convert to US spelling

	* Converted the documentation to Roxygen

	* DESCRIPTION (Version, Date): Release 2019.07.09

	Many changes in put in place for the submission to the Journal of Statistical Software.

	* Moment-matching criterion for truncation of the infinite series. Implementation of the strategy in J. Arbel and I. Prünster, “A moment-matching Ferguson & Klass algorithm,” Stat. Comput., vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 3–17, 2017.

	* Clustering estimation. It is now possible to estimate the optimal clustering from the MCMC sample, based on a range of loss functions. Implementation of the ideas in S. Wade and Z. Ghahramani, “Bayesian cluster analysis: Point estimation and credible balls (with discussion),” Bayesian Anal., vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 559–626, 2018. and R. Rastelli and N. Friel, “Optimal Bayesian estimators for latent variable cluster models,” Stat. Comput., vol. 28, no. 6, pp. 1169–1186, Nov. 2018 via an interface to GreedyEPL, and functions for clustering visualisation.

	* Implementation of several Goodness of fit plots

	* Renaming of function argument: Beta -> Kappa. The parameter Beta actually corresponded to the parameter Kappa in E. Barrios, A. Lijoi, L. E. Nieto-Barajas, and I. Prünster, “Modeling with Normalized Random Measure Mixture Models,” Stat. Sci., vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 313–334, 2013. It did not correspond to the parameter Beta also defined in this publication, which made things very confusing for anyone trying to understand the package from the paper.
