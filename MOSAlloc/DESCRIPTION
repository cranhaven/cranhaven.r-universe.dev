Description: Provides a framework for multipurpose optimal resource
        allocation in survey sampling, extending the classical optimal
        allocation principles introduced by Tschuprow (1923) and Neyman
        (1934) to multidomain and multivariate allocation problems. The
        primary method mosalloc() allows for the consideration of
        precision and cost constraints at the subpopulation level while
        minimizing either a vector of sampling errors or survey costs
        across a broad range of optimal sample allocation problems. The
        approach supports both single- and multistage designs. For
        single-stage stratified random sampling, the mosallocSTRS()
        function offers a user- friendly interface. Sensitivity
        analysis is supported through the problem's dual variables,
        which are naturally obtained via the internal use of the
        Embedded Conic Solver from the 'ECOSolveR' package. See Willems
        (2025, <doi:10.25353/ubtr-9200-484c-5c89>) for a detailed
        description of the theory behind 'MOSAlloc'.
