#' Add a new valid source to an ontology
#'
#' @param ontology [`ontology(1)`][list]\cr either a path where the ontology is
#'   stored, or an already loaded ontology into which the new source should be
#'   included.
#' @param name [`character(1)`][character]\cr the name of the new source (must
#'   not contain empty spaces).
#' @param version [`character(1)`][character]\cr an optional version of the new
#'   source (any value is allowed, but should be a value that follows
#'   \href{https://semver.org/}{semantic versioning}). Either version or date
#'   need to be given.
#' @param date [`character(1)`][character]\cr an optional date at which that
#'   version of an external vocabulary has been created. Should be a value of
#'   the form YYYY-MM-DD. Either version or date need to be given.
#' @param description [`character(1)`][character]\cr a verbatim description of
#'   the new source.
#' @param homepage [`character(1)`][character]\cr the homepage of the new
#'   source, typically the place where additional information or meta-data could
#'   be retrieved in a non-formalised way.
#' @param uri_prefix [`character(1)`][character]\cr the basic uniform resource
#'   locator (URL) all concepts of a new source have in common and which is thus
#'   the basis to construct the concept specific URI.
#' @param license [`character(1)`][character]\cr the licenses under which the
#'   new source is published.
#' @param notes [`character(1)`][character]\cr any notes on the new source that
#'   don't fit into any of the other meta-data fields here.
#' @details Fundamentally, there are two types of sources that can be defined
#'   with this function. \itemize{\item \emph{attribute collections}: where a
#'   collection of terms or concepts are associated as a descriptive attribute
#'   to the harmonised concepts, and \item \emph{linked open data}: where the
#'   concepts that occur in another vocabulary or ontology and which are
#'   themselves part of linked datasets (and hence have a valid URI) are
#'   associated as related concepts to the harmonised concepts.} In the latter
#'   case, each mapped concept should be provided by its ID and the source needs
#'   to have a URL that allows in combination with the concept IDs to construct
#'   the URI under which the mapped concepts are stored in the semantic web.
