\description{
Internal wrapper function to classify multiple species names into their
taxonomic components (genus, species, author). Peru mammals database does
not include infraspecific taxa, but this function handles "sp." notations
for undescribed species (e.g., "Akodon sp. Ancash").

\strong{Automatic normalization}: Empty strings ("", "  ", etc.) are automatically
converted to NA before processing, as they represent missing values and
cannot match any names in the database.
