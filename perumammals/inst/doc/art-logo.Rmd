## Description

The perumammals logo is a hexagonal badge featuring a vibrant composition that celebrates Peru's extraordinary mammalian diversity across its diverse ecoregions. The artwork showcases iconic Peruvian mammals.

### Featured Species and Elements

**Spectacled Bear (*Tremarctos ornatus*)**

The centerpiece features Peru's only bear species, an Andean endemic and national symbol of conservation, representing the Yungas and cloud forest ecosystems.


**Bat (Chiroptera)**

Representing the incredible diversity of Neotropical bats found in Peru's lowland and montane forests, one of the most species-rich mammalian orders in the country.

**Small Rodent**

Depicting the often-overlooked micromammals that constitute a significant portion of Peru's mammalian biodiversity, particularly in grassland and scrub ecoregions.

**Andean Bromeliad (*Puya*)**

A striking red-orange flowering plant native to high-elevation ecosystems, symbolizing the unique flora-fauna relationships in Peruvian montane habitats.

### Design Elements

The hexagonal design with teal borders and light blue background creates a modern, scientific aesthetic while the vertical "PERUMAMMALS" text establishes clear package identity. The composition balances charismatic megafauna with lesser-known taxa, reflecting the package's comprehensive approach to documenting all 573+ mammal species recorded in Peru across 10 distinct ecoregions.
