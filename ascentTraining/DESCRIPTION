Description: Datasets to be used primarily in conjunction with Ascent
        training materials but also for the book 'SAMS Teach Yourself R
        in 24 Hours' (ISBN: 978-0-672-33848-9). Version 1.0-7 is
        largely for use with the book; however, version 1.1 has a much
        greater focus on use with training materials, whilst retaining
        compatibility with the book.
