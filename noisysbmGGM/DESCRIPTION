Description: Greedy Bayesian algorithm to fit the noisy stochastic
        block model to an observed sparse graph. Moreover, a graph
        inference procedure to recover Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM)
        from real data. This procedure comes with a control of the
        false discovery rate. The method is described in the article
        "Enhancing the Power of Gaussian Graphical Model Inference by
        Modeling the Graph Structure" by Kilian, Rebafka, and Villers
        (2024) <arXiv:2402.19021>.
