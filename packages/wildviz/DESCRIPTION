Description: Fetches data from three disparate data sources and allows
        user to perform analyses on them. It offers two core
        components: 1. A robust data retrieval and preparation
        infrastructure for wildfire, climate, and air quality index
        data and 2. A simple, informative, and interactive
        visualizations of the aforementioned datasets for California
        counties from 2011 through 2015. The sources of data are:
        wildfire data from Kaggle
        <https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires>,
        climate data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
        Administration <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token>, and
        air quality data from the Environmental Protection Agency
        <https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html>.
