\title{Calculate change in richness resulting from a percent reduction in flow}
\usage{
richness_change(stats, pctchg, xval = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{stats}{A dataframe of ELF statistics}

\item{pctchg}{Decrease in flow as a percent (e.g. 10 equals 10 percent reduction in flow).}

\item{xval}{x-axis value for assessing percent change in richness. When supplied, the function will calculate percent change in richness at a specific stream size (e.g. 50 equals a stream size with mean annual flow of 50 cfs).}
}
\value{
Richness change value is returned
}
\description{
Calculates absolute or percent richness change from streamflow reduction
}
\examples{

# We don't run this example by R CMD check, because it takes >10s
