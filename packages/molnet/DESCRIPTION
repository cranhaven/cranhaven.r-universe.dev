Description: Networks provide a means to incorporate molecular
        interactions into reasoning, but on the omics-level, they are
        currently mainly used to combine genomic and proteomic
        information. We here present a novel network analysis pipeline
        that enables integrative analysis of multi-omics data including
        metabolomics. It allows for comparative conclusions between two
        different conditions, such as tumor subgroups, healthy vs.
        disease, or generally control vs. perturbed. Our approach
        focuses on interactions and their strength instead of on node
        properties and includes molecules with low abundance and
        unknown function. We use correlation-induced networks that are
        reduced and combined to form heterogeneous, multi-omics
        molecular networks. Prior information such as
        metabolite-protein interactions are incorporated. A semi-local,
        path-based integration step denoises the network and ensures
        integrative conclusions. As case studies, we investigate
        differential drug response in breast cancer tumor datasets
        providing proteomics, transcriptomics, phospho-proteomics and
        metabolomics data and contrasting patients with different
        estrogen receptor status. Our proposed pipeline leverages
        multi-omics data for differential predictions, e.g. on drug
        response, and includes prior information on interactions. The
        case study presented in the vignette uses data published by
        Krug (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.036>. The package
