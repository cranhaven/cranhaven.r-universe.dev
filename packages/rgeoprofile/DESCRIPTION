Author: Jamie Spaulding and Keith Morris
Maintainer: Jamie Spaulding <jspaulding02@hamline.edu>
Description: An implementation of functions for the analysis of serial
        crime incidents. The package implements algorithms for the
        geographical profiling of serial incidents in attempt to
        prioritize the area in which the anchor point or home base of
        the perpetrator is located. The geographic profiling methods in
        the package are implemented based upon the 'Dragnet' software
        by Canter, Coffey, Huntley, and Missen (2000)
        <doi:10.1023/A:1007551316253>, the 'CrimeStat' software by
        Levine (2013)
        <https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/crimestat-spatial-statistics-program-analysis-crime-incident-locations>,
        and the criminal geographic targeting model outlined in Rossmo
        (2000, ISBN:978-0849381294) and Rossmo (1995)
