Description: Permits to apply the 'Vertex Sort' algorithm (Jothi et al.
        (2009) <10.1038/msb.2009.52>) to a graph in order to elucidate
        its hierarchical structure. It also allows graphic
        visualization of the sorted graph by exporting the results to a
        cytoscape friendly format. Moreover, it offers five different
        algorithms of graph randomization: 1) Randomize a graph with
        preserving node degrees, 2) with preserving similar node
        degrees, 3) without preserving node degrees, 4) with preserving
        node in-degrees and 5) with preserving node out-degrees.
