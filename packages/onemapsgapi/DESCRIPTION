Description: An R wrapper for the 'OneMap.Sg' API
        <https://www.onemap.gov.sg/docs/>. Functions help users query
        data from the API and return raw JSON data in "tidy" formats.
        Support is also available for users to retrieve data from
        multiple API calls and integrate results into single
        dataframes, without needing to clean and merge the data
        themselves. This package is best suited for users who would
        like to perform analyses with Singapore's spatial data without
        having to perform excessive data cleaning.
