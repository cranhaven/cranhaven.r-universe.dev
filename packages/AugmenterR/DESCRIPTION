Description: Implementation of a data augmentation technique based on
        conditional entropy It was devised by both authors during their
        masters and is discussed in detail in the second author
        dissertation. It is able to create novel samples conditioned on
        a desired value of a categorical attribute, as a way to augment
        data for classification tasks Tests discussed in the
        dissertation and future paper present that the technique
        satisfies several statistical assumptions for the novel
        samples. It also shows significant improvement for machine
        learning models trained on small data.
