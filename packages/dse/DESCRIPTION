Title: Dynamic Systems Estimation (Time Series Package)
Description: Tools for multivariate, linear, time-invariant, time
        series models. This includes ARMA and state-space
        representations, and methods for converting between them. It
        also includes simulation methods and several estimation
        functions. The package has functions for looking at model
        roots, stability, and forecasts at different horizons. The ARMA
        model representation is general, so that VAR, VARX, ARIMA,
        ARMAX, ARIMAX can all be considered to be special cases. Kalman
        filter and smoother estimates can be obtained from the state
        space model, and state-space model reduction techniques are
        implemented. An introduction and User's Guide is available in a
        vignette.
