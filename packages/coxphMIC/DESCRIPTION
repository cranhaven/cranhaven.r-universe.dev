Description: Sparse estimation for Cox PH models is done via Minimum
        approximated Information Criterion (MIC) by Su, Wijayasinghe,
        Fan, and Zhang (2016) <DOI:10.1111/biom.12484>. MIC mimics the
        best subset selection using a penalized likelihood approach yet
        with no need of a tuning parameter. The problem is further
        reformulated with a re-parameterization step so that it reduces
        to one unconstrained non-convex yet smooth programming problem,
        which can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, the
        re-parameterization tactic yields an additional advantage in
        terms of circumventing post-selection inference.
