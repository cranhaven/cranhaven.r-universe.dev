Description: It interactively or programmatically label points within
        custom gates on two dimensions
        <https://github.com/stemangiola/tidygate>. The information is
        added to your tibble. It is based on the package 'gatepoints'
        from Wajid Jawaid (who is also author of this package). The
        code of 'gatepoints' was nto integrated in 'tidygate'. The
        benefits are (i) in interactive mode you can draw your gates on
        extensive 'ggplot'-like scatter plots; (ii) you can draw
        multiple gates; and (iii) you can save your gates and apply the
        programmatically.
