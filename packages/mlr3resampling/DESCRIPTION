Description: A supervised learning algorithm inputs a train set, and
        outputs a prediction function, which can be used on a test set.
        If each data point belongs to a group (such as geographic
        region, year, etc), then how do we know if it is possible to
        train on one group, and predict accurately on another group?
        Cross-validation can be used to determine the extent to which
        this is possible, by first assigning fold IDs from 1 to K to
        all data (possibly using stratification, usually by group and
        label). Then we loop over test sets (group/fold combinations),
        train sets (same group, other groups, all groups), and compute
        test/prediction accuracy for each combination.  Comparing
        test/prediction accuracy between same and other, we can
        determine the extent to which it is possible (perfect if
        same/other have similar test accuracy for each group; other is
        usually somewhat less accurate than same; other can be just as
        bad as featureless baseline when the groups have different
        patterns). For more information,
        <https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2023/R-gen-new-subsets/>
        describes the method in depth. How many train samples are
        required to get accurate predictions on a test set?
        Cross-validation can be used to answer this question, with
        variable size train sets.
