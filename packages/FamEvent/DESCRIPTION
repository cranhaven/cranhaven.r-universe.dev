Description: Simulates age-at-onset traits associated with a
        segregating major gene in family data obtained from
        population-based, clinic-based, or multi-stage designs.
        Appropriate ascertainment correction is utilized to estimate
        age-dependent penetrance functions either parametrically from
        the fitted model or nonparametrically from the data. The
        Expectation and Maximization algorithm can infer missing
        genotypes and carrier probabilities estimated from family's
        genotype and phenotype information or from a fitted model. Plot
        functions include pedigrees of simulated families and predicted
        penetrance curves based on specified parameter values. For more
