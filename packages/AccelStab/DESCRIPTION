Description: Estimate the Šesták–Berggren kinetic model (degradation
        model) from experimental data. A A closed-form (analytic)
        solution to the degradation model is implemented as a
        non-linear fit, allowing for the extrapolation of the
        degradation of a drug product - both in time and temperature.
        Parametric bootstrap, with kinetic parameters drawn from the
        multivariate t-distribution, and analytical formulae (the delta
        method) are available options to calculate the confidence and
        prediction intervals. The results (modelling, extrapolations
        and statistical intervals) can be visualised with multiple
        plots. The examples illustrate the accelerated stability
        modelling in drugs and vaccines development.
