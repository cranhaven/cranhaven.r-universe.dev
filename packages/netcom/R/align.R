#' @title Network Alignment
#'
#' @description Network alignment by comparing the entropies of diffusion kernels simulated on two networks.
#' \code{align} takes two networks stored as matrices and returns a node-level alignment between them.
#'
#' @param network_1_input The first network being aligned, which must be in matrix form. If the two
#'     networks are of different sizes, it will be easier to interpret the output if this is the smaller one.
#'
#' @param network_2_input The second network, which also must be a matrix. 
#'
#' @param base Defaults to 1. The base in the series of time steps to sample the diffusion kernels at. If base = 1 every time step
#'     is sampled. If base = 2, only time steps that are powers of 2 are sampled, etc. Larger values place more emphasis on 
#'     earlier time steps. This can be helpful if the diffusion kernel quickly converges to an equilibrium, and also
#'     runs faster. 
#'     
#' @param max_duration Defaults to twice the diameter of the larger network. Sets the number of time steps to allow the diffusion
#'     kernel to spread for, which is the smallest power of base that is at least as large as max_duration.     
#'
#' @param characterization Defaults to "entropy". Determines how the diffusion kernels are characterized. Either "entropy" or "gini". "entropy" 
#'     is a size-normalized version of Shannon's entropy with base e (Euler's number). This is also known as interaction or species evenness
#'     in ecology. "gini" is the Gini coefficient.
#'
#' @param normalization Defaults to FALSE. Determines if self-loops should be augmented such that edge weights are
#'     proportional to those in network_1_input and network_2_input. FALSE by default because this is inappropriate for
#'     unweighted binary/logical networks where edges indicate only the presence of an interaction.
#'     
#' @param unit_test Defaults to FALSE. Saves the following intermediate steps to help with general troubleshooting: post-processing matrix
#'     representations of both networks, time steps at which the diffusion kernels were sampled, the diffusion kernels at those time steps,
#'     the characterizations of the diffusion kernels at those time steps, and the cost matrix fed into the Hungarian algorithm where the 
#'     ij element is the difference between the characterization-over-time curves for node i in the first network and node j in the second network.
#'
#' @details Network alignment pairs nodes between two networks so as to maximize similarities in their edge structures. 
#'     This allows information from well-studied systems to be used in poorly studied ones, such as to identify
#'     unknown protein functions or ecosystems that will respond similarly to a given disturbance. Most network alignment
#'     algorithms focus on measures of topological overlap between edges of the two networks. The method implemented here 
#'     compares nodes using the predictability of dynamics originating from each node in each network. Consider network alignment 
#'     as trying to compare two hypothetical cities of houses connected by roads. The approach implemented here is to pairwise 
#'     compare each house with those in the other city by creating a house-specific signature. This is accomplished by quantifying 
#'     the predictability of the location of a person at various times after they left their house, assuming they were moving randomly. 
#'     This predictability across all houses captures much of the way each city is organized and functions. \code{align} 
#'     uses this conceptual rationale to align two networks, with nodes as houses, edges as roads, and random diffusion representing people leaving 
#'     their houses and walking around the city to other houses. The mechanics of this, which are conceptually akin to flow 
#'     algorithms and Laplacian dynamics, can be analytically expressed as a Markov chain raised to successive powers which are 
#'     the durations of diffusion.
#'     
#'     Note that the novel part of \code{align} lies in creating a matrix where the ij entry is a measure of similarity between node i in the first
#'     network and node j in the second. The final alignment is found using \code{solve_LSAP} in the package \code{clue}, which uses the 
#'     Hungarian algorithm to solve the assignment problem optimally.
#'
#' @return 
#'  \item{score}{Mean of all alignment scores between nodes in both original networks network_1_input and network_2_input.}
#'  \item{alignment}{Data frame of the nodes in both networks, sorted numerically by the first network (why it helps to make the smaller network the first one), and the corresponding alignment score.}
#'  \item{score_with_padding}{Same as score but includes the padding nodes in the smaller network, which can be thought of as a size gap penalty for aligning differently sized networks. Only included if the input networks are different sizes.}
#'  \item{alignment_with_padding}{Same as alignment but includes the padding nodes in the smaller network. Only included if the input networks are different sizes.}
