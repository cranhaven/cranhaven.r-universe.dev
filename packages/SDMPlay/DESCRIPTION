Description: Species distribution modelling (SDM) has been developed
        for several years to address conservation issues, assess the
        direct impact of human activities on ecosystems and predict the
        potential distribution shifts of invasive species (see Elith et
        al. 2006, Pearson 2007, Elith and Leathwick 2009). SDM relates
        species occurrences with environmental information and can
        predict species distribution on their entire occupied space.
        This approach has been increasingly applied to Southern Ocean
        case studies, but requires corrections in such a context, due
        to the broad scale area, the limited number of presence records
        available and the spatial and temporal aggregations of these
        datasets. SDMPlay is a pedagogic package that will allow you to
        compute SDMs, to understand the overall method, and to produce
        model outputs. The package, along with its associated
        vignettes, highlights the different steps of model calibration
        and describes how to choose the best methods to generate
        accurate and relevant outputs. SDMPlay proposes codes to apply
        a popular machine learning approach, BRT (Boosted Regression
        Trees) and introduces MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy). It contains
        occurrences of marine species and environmental descriptors
        datasets as examples associated to several vignette tutorials
