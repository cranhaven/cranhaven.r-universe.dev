Description: R implementation of a multivariate meta-analysis of
        randomized controlled trials (RCT) with the difference in
        restricted mean survival times (RMSTD). Use this package with
        individual patient level data from an RCT for a time-to-event
        outcome to determine combined effect estimates according to 4
        methods: 1) a univariate meta-analysis using observed treatment
        effects, 2) a univariate meta-analysis using effects predicted
        by fitted Royston-Parmar flexible parametric models, 3)
        multivariate meta-analysis with analytically derived
        covariance, 4) multivariate meta-analysis with bootstrap
        derived covariance. This package computes all combined effects
        and provides an RMSTD curve with combined effect estimates and
        their confidence intervals.
