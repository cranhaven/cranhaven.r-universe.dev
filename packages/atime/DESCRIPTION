Description: Computing and visualizing comparative asymptotic timings
        of different algorithms and code versions. Also includes
        functionality for comparing empirical timings with expected
        references such as linear or quadratic,
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_computational_complexity>
        Also includes functionality for measuring asymptotic memory and
        other quantities.
