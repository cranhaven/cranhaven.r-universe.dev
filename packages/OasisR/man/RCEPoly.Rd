\title{A function to compute Polycentric Relative Centralisation Index}
\usage{
RCEPoly(x, dc = NULL, center = 1, spatobj = NULL, folder = NULL, shape = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{- an object of class matrix (or which can be coerced to that class), 
where each column represents the distribution of a group within 
spatial units. The number of columns should be greater than 1 (at least 2 
groups are required). You should not include a column with total 
population, because this will be interpreted as a group.}

\item{dc}{- a numeric matrix/vector containing the distances between spatial units
centroids and the central spatial unit(s).}

\item{center}{- a numeric vector  giving the number of the spatial units that 
represent the centers in the table}

\item{spatobj}{- a spatial object (SpatialPolygonsDataFrame) with 
geographic information}

\item{folder}{- a character vector with the folder (directory) 
name indicating where the shapefile is located on the drive}

\item{shape}{- a character vector with the name of the shapefile 
(without the .shp extension).}
}
\value{
a matrix containing relative centralisation index values
}
\description{
The polycentric version of the relative centralisation index. 
The function can be used in two ways: to provide a matrix containing 
the distances between spatial/organizational unit centroids or a external  
geographic information source (spatial object or shape file).
}
\examples{
x <- segdata@data[ ,1:2]
foldername <- system.file('extdata', package = 'OasisR')
shapename <- 'segdata'

RCEPoly(x, spatobj = segdata, center = c(28, 83) )

RCEPoly(x, folder = foldername, shape = shapename, center = c(28, 83))

center <- c(28, 83)
polydist <- matrix(data = NA, nrow = nrow(x), ncol = length(center))
for (i in 1:ncol(polydist))
  polydist[,i] <- distcenter(spatobj = segdata, center = center[i])
RCEPoly(x, dc = polydist)

distmin <- vector(length = nrow(x))
for (i in 1:nrow(polydist)) distmin[i] <- min(polydist[i,])
RCE(x, dc = distmin)
