Description: Implements the Goldilocks adaptive trial design for a time
        to event outcome using a piecewise exponential model and
        conjugate Gamma prior distributions. The method closely follows
        the article by Broglio and colleagues
        <doi:10.1080/10543406.2014.888569>, which allows users to
        explore the operating characteristics of different trial
        designs.
