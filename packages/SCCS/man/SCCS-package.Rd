\title{The Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) Method
%%What the package does (short line)
%%~~ package title ~~
}
\description{Fits the self-controlled case series model used to investigate the association between a time-varying exposures such as vaccines or other drugs and an adverse event. Some extensions of the SCCS method can be fitted with this package.

Note: Ages and times describing the start and end of observation, exposure times, and event times, should be expressed as integers. In most of the datasets, units of time are days; other choices may be appropriate according to context, but must be given as integers. Ages appearing as covariates need not be integers.
