Description: Implements an S3 class for storing 'UTF-8' strings, based
        on regular character vectors. Also contains routines to
        portably read and write 'UTF-8' encoded text files, to convert
        all strings in an object to 'UTF-8', and to create character
        vectors with various encodings.
