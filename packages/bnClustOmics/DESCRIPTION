Description: Unsupervised Bayesian network-based clustering of
        multi-omics data. Both binary and continuous data types are
        allowed as inputs. The package serves a dual purpose: it
        clusters (patient) samples and learns the multi-omics networks
        that characterize discovered clusters. Prior network knowledge
        (e.g., public interaction databases) can be included via
        blacklisting and penalization matrices. For clustering, the EM
        algorithm is employed. For structure search at the M-step, the
        Bayesian approach is used. The output includes membership
        assignments of samples, cluster-specific MAP networks, and
        posterior probabilities of all edges in the discovered
        networks. In addition to likelihood, AIC and BIC scores are
        returned. They can be used for choosing the number of clusters.
