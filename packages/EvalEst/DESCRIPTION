Package: EvalEst
Version: 2024.2-1
Title: Dynamic Systems Estimation - Extensions
Description: Provides functions for evaluating (time series) model
        estimation methods. These facilitate Monte Carlo experiments of
        repeated simulations and estimations. Also provides methods for
        looking at the distribution of the results from these
        experiments, including model roots (which are an equivalence
        class invariant).
Depends: R (>= 2.5.0), tfplot, dse (>= 2007.10-1)
Imports: setRNG, tframe (>= 2007.5-3), stats, graphics
LazyLoad: yes
