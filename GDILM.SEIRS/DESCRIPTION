Description: Geographically Dependent Individual Level Models (GDILMs)
        within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible
        (SEIRS) framework are applied to model infectious disease
        transmission, incorporating reinfection dynamics. This package
        employs a likelihood based Monte Carlo Expectation Conditional
        Maximization (MCECM) algorithm for estimating model parameters.
        It also provides tools for GDILM fitting, parameter estimation,
        AIC calculation on real pandemic data, and simulation studies
        customized to user-defined model settings.
