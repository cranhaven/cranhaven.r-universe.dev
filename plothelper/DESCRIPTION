Description: An extension to 'ggplot2' and 'magick'. It contains three
        groups of functions: Functions in the first group draw
        'ggplot2' - based plots: geom_shading_bar() draws barplot with
        shading colors in each bar. geom_rect_cm(), geom_circle_cm()
        and geom_ellipse_cm() draw rectangles, circles and ellipses
        with centimeter as their unit. Thus their sizes do not change
        when the coordinate system or the aspect ratio changes.
        annotation_transparent_text() draws labels with transparent
        texts. annotation_shading_polygon() draws irregular polygons
        with shading colors. Functions in the second group generate
        coordinates for regular shapes and make linear transformations.
        Functions in the third group are 'magick' - based functions
        facilitating image processing.
