Description: Efficient algorithm for solving PU (Positive and
        Unlabeled) problem in low or high dimensional setting with
        lasso or group lasso penalty. The algorithm uses
        Maximization-Minorization and (block) coordinate descent.
        Sparse calculation and parallel computing are supported for the
        computational speed-up. See Hyebin Song, Garvesh Raskutti
        (2018) <arXiv:1711.08129>.
