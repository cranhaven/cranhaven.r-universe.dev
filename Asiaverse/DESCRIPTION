        Datasets
Version: 0.1.0
Maintainer: Renzo Caceres Rossi <arenzocaceresrossi@gmail.com>
Description: A metapackage that brings together a comprehensive
        collection of R packages providing access to APIs functions and
        curated datasets from China, Japan, South Korea, India, and
        Indonesia. It includes real-time and historical data through
        public RESTful APIs (Nager.Date, World Bank API, REST Countries
        API) and extensive curated collections of open datasets
        covering economics, demographics, public health, environmental
        data, natural disasters, political indicators, and social
        metrics. Designed to provide researchers, analysts, educators,
        and data scientists with centralized access to Asian data
        sources, this metapackage facilitates reproducible research,
        comparative analysis, and teaching applications focused on
        these five major Asian countries. Included packages: -
        'ChinAPIs': APIs functions and curated datasets for China and
        Hong Kong covering air quality, demographics, input-output
        tables, epidemiology, political structure, and social
        indicators. - 'JapanAPIs': APIs functions and curated datasets
        for Japan including natural disasters, economic production,
        vehicle industry, air quality, demographics, and administrative
        divisions. - 'SouthKoreAPIs': APIs functions and curated
        datasets for South Korea covering public health outbreaks,
        social surveys, elections, economic indicators, natural
        disasters, climate data, energy consumption, cultural
        information, and financial markets. - 'IndiAPIs': APIs
        functions and curated datasets for India with comprehensive
        collections and real-time access to economic, demographic, and
        geopolitical indicators. - 'IndonesiAPIs': APIs functions and
        curated datasets for Indonesia covering holidays, economic
        indicators, consumer prices, poverty probability, food prices
        by region, tourism destinations, and minimum wage statistics.
