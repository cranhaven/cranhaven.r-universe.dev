# cnefetools 0.2.3

* Fixed missing hexagons at the edges of the H3 grid. `h3jsr::polygon_to_cells()`
  only returns hexagons whose centroid falls inside the municipality boundary, so
  border hexagons that overlap the boundary without their center being inside
  were silently excluded. `build_h3_grid()` now adds those hexagons by checking
  the immediate neighbors of the grid against the municipality boundary (#62).

* `cnefe_counts()` and `compute_lumi()` now expose a `cache` parameter
  (default `TRUE`), consistent with `tracts_to_h3()` and `tracts_to_polygon()`
  (#58).

* New `clear_cache_muni()` function to delete cached CNEFE ZIP files from
  the user cache directory, with optional filtering by municipality code (#59).

* New `clear_cache_tracts()` function to delete cached census tract Parquet
  files, with optional filtering by state (UF) code (#59).

# cnefetools 0.2.2

* Resubmission to CRAN following package removal on 2026-02-26.
* No functional changes. Retains the `skip_on_cran()` fix from v0.2.1 for the
  DuckDB spatial extension segfault on r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang.

# cnefetools 0.2.1

* Adds `skip_on_cran()` to `test-tracts_to_h3.R` to prevent a segfault on
  r-devel-linux-x86_64-fedora-clang caused by an ABI mismatch between the
  clang-compiled DuckDB binary and GCC-built spatial extension (duckdb/duckdb-r#1107).

# cnefetools 0.2.0

## New functions

- New `tracts_to_polygon()` for dasymetric interpolation from census
  tracts to user-supplied polygons, using CNEFE dwelling points as
  ancillary data.
- New `tracts_variables_ref` reference table mapping cnefetools variable
  names to official IBGE census tract codes.

## Major changes

- `hex_cnefe_counts()` has been renamed to `cnefe_counts()`. The
  function now accepts user-supplied polygons via `polygon_type = "user"`
  in addition to H3 hexagons (`polygon_type = "hex"`, default).
- `compute_lumi()` gains support for user-supplied polygons via the same
  `polygon_type` parameter, and a new land-use mix indicator: ICE (Index
  of Concentration at Extremes).
- `tracts_to_h3()` and `tracts_to_polygon()` gain five new interpolation
  variables related to race: `race_branca`, `race_preta`, `race_parda`,
  `race_amarela` and `race_indigena`.
- `read_cnefe()`, `cnefe_counts()`, `compute_lumi()`, and
  `tracts_to_h3()` gain a `year` argument (default `2022`) to prepare
  for future CNEFE editions.

## Improvements

- All user-facing functions now use the cli package (>= 3.6.0) for
  formatted console messages, replacing plain `message()` calls.
- Improved diagnostic output in `tracts_to_h3()` and
  `tracts_to_polygon()` with two-stage reporting structure.
- Census tract Parquet assets are now downloaded via piggyback from
  GitHub Releases, with on-demand caching.

## Bug fixes

- Removed inconsistencies in spatial join operations in `cnefe_counts()`,
  `compute_lumi()`, and `tracts_to_polygon()` with DuckDB.
- Fixed community extension loading failures in DuckDB.
- Fixed temporary file path bugs in `tracts_to_h3()` and
  `tracts_to_polygon()`.
- Fixed invalid geometry handling when user-supplied polygons.

## Documentation

- Six pre-rendered pkgdown articles: reading CNEFE data, address counts,
  land-use mix indices, dasymetric interpolation, FAQ, and a DuckDB
  performance benchmark.
- The package now features a new, more polished logo with improved visual quality.

# cnefetools 0.1.1

- Adds Balance Index (BAL), `bal` to the `compute_lumi()` function.

# cnefetools 0.1.0

- New: `tracts_to_h3()` for dasymetric interpolation from tract aggregates to CNEFE dwelling points and H3 hexagons using DuckDB (spatial + h3).
- Added UF-level census tract Parquet assets (WKB geometry) hosted on GitHub Releases and downloaded on-demand with caching.

# cnefetools 0.0.6

- Moves DBI and duckdb to Imports so the DuckDB backend works out of the box
- Removes silent fallback to `backend = "r"` when `backend = "duckdb"` is requested
- No changes to outputs; behavior is unchanged aside from dependency handling

# cnefetools 0.0.5

-   Makes unit tests more reproducible and CI-friendly by removing dependencies on network access and local cache state (offline ZIP fixture and mocked downloads)
-   Improves robustness of `read_cnefe(output = "sf")` by handling missing coordinates before converting to `sf`
-   Updates `COD_ESPECIE` documentation and removes tidyselect deprecation warnings in tests and internals

# cnefetools 0.0.4

-   Major speed-up for H3 assignment and hex-level aggregation via DuckDB + H3 extension (SQL), with runtimes dropping from minutes to seconds for large municipalities
-   Adds a configurable backend with backwards compatibility: `backend = "duckdb"` (default) or `backend = "r"` for `hex_cnefe_counts()` and `compute_lumi()`
-   Refactors internals to reuse cached ZIPs and consolidate common helpers, reducing repeated overhead and improving maintainability

# cnefetools 0.0.3

-   More robust downloads with retry logic and increased timeout when needed
-   Avoids leaving partial or corrupted ZIP files in the cache
-   Automatically detects corrupted cached ZIPs and re-downloads before extraction

# cnefetools 0.0.2

-   Add `compute_lumi()` to compute land-use mix indicators (EI, HHI, adapted HHI, BGBI) on H3 grids.
-   Extend README with examples for Fortaleza (code 2304400) and BGBI maps.

# cnefetools 0.0.1

# cnefetools 0.0.0.9000

-   Initial development version. Basic package infrastructure set up.
