Description: Managing postgraduate programmes involves extracting
        information from Lattes CVs. This information can be used for
        strategic planning and self-evaluation, as well as for
        producing reports on the Sucupira Platform. Summary reports are
        produced for each period and course (specialisation, master's
        and doctorate), showing bibliographic production with and
        without student participation, as well as papers at events,
        technical or technological production, ongoing and completed
        supervision, research projects, exchanges (visiting professor,
        postdoctoral or short-term leave), awards and general activity
        indicators. Based on this information, a detailed report is
        then drawn up for each lecturer, taking into account their
        participation in exam boards, their research project
        contributions, their technical collaborations (e.g. advisory
        committee, editorial board) and the subjects they teach. For
        more details see Pagliosa and Nascimento (2021)
