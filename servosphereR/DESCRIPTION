Description: Functions that facilitate and speed up the analysis of
        data produced by a Syntech servosphere
        <http://www.ockenfels-syntech.com/products/locomotion-compensation/>,
        which is equipment for studying the movement behavior of
        arthropods. This package is designed to make working with data
        produced from a servosphere easy for someone new to or
        unfamiliar with R. The functions provided in this package fall
        into three broad-use categories: functions for cleaning raw
        data produced by the servosphere software, functions for
        deriving movement variables based on position data, and
        functions for summarizing movement variables for easier
        analysis. These functions are built with functions from the
        tidyverse package to work efficiently, as a single servosphere
        file may consist of hundreds of thousands of rows of data and a
        user may wish to analyze hundreds of files at a time. Many of
        the movement variables derivable through this package are
        described in the following papers: Otálora-Luna, Fernando;
