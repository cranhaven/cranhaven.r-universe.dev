Description: Applies sequential clustering algorithm to animal location
        data based on user-defined parameters. Plots interactive
        cluster maps and provides a summary dataframe with attributes
        for each cluster commonly used as covariates in subsequent
        modeling efforts. Additional functions provide individual
        keyhole markup language plots for quick assessment, and export
        of global positioning system exchange format files for
        navigation purposes. Methods can be found at
        <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13572>.
