Description: Functions for multiple knockoff inference using summary
        statistics, e.g. Z-scores. The knockoff inference is a general
        procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) when
        performing variable selection. This package provides a
        procedure which performs knockoff inference without ever
        constructing individual knockoffs (GhostKnockoff). It
        additionally supports multiple knockoff inference for improved
        stability and reproducibility. Moreover, it supports
        meta-analysis of multiple overlapping studies.
