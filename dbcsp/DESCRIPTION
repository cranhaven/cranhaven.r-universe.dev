Description: A way to apply Distance-Based Common Spatial Patterns
        (DB-CSP) techniques in different fields, both classical Common
        Spatial Patterns (CSP) as well as DB-CSP. The method is
        composed of two phases: applying the DB-CSP algorithm and
        performing a classification. The main idea behind the CSP is to
        use a linear transform to project data into low-dimensional
        subspace with a projection matrix, in such a way that each row
        consists of weights for signals. This transformation maximizes
        the variance of two-class signal matrices.The dbcsp object is
        created to compute the projection vectors. For exploratory and
        descriptive purpose, plot and boxplot functions can be used.
        Functions train, predict and selectQ are implemented for the
        classification step.
