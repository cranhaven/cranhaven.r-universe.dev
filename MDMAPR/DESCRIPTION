Description: Runs a Shiny web application that merges raw 'qPCR'
        fluorescence data with related metadata to visualize species
        presence/absence detection patterns and assess data quality.
        The application calculates threshold values from raw
        fluorescence data using a method based on the second derivative
        method, Luu-The et al (2005) <doi:10.2144/05382RR05>, and
        utilizes the ‘chipPCR’ package by Rödiger, Burdukiewicz, &
        Schierack (2015) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv205> to
        calculate Cq values. The application has the ability to connect
        to a custom developed MySQL database to populate the
        applications interface. The application allows users to
        interact with visualizations such as a dynamic map,
        amplification curves and standard curves, that allow for
        zooming and/or filtering. It also enables the generation of
        customized exportable reports based on filtered mapping data.
