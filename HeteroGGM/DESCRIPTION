Description: The goal of this package is to user-friendly realizing
        Gaussian graphical model-based heterogeneity analysis.
        Recently, several Gaussian graphical model-based heterogeneity
        analysis techniques have been developed. A common
        methodological limitation is that the number of subgroups is
        assumed to be known a priori, which is not realistic. In a very
        recent study (Ren et al., 2022), a novel approach based on the
        penalized fusion technique is developed to fully
        data-dependently determine the number and structure of
        subgroups in Gaussian graphical model-based heterogeneity
        analysis. It opens the door for utilizing the Gaussian
        graphical model technique in more practical settings. Beyond
        Ren et al. (2022), more estimations and functions are added, so
        that the package is self-contained and more comprehensive and
        can provide ``more direct'' insights to practitioners (with the
        visualization function). Reference: Ren, M., Zhang S., Zhang Q.
