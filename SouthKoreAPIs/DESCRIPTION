Version: 0.1.1
Maintainer: Renzo Caceres Rossi <arenzocaceresrossi@gmail.com>
Description: Provides functions to access data from public RESTful APIs
        including 'Nager.Date', 'World Bank API', and 'REST Countries
        API', retrieving real-time or historical data related to South
        Korea, such as holidays, economic indicators, and international
        demographic and geopolitical indicators. Additionally, the
        package includes one of the largest curated collections of open
        datasets focused on South Korea, covering topics such as public
        health outbreaks, demographics, social surveys, elections,
        economic indicators, natural disasters, administrative
        divisions, air quality, climate data, energy consumption,
        cultural information, and financial markets. The package
        supports reproducible research and teaching by integrating
        reliable international APIs and structured datasets from
        public, academic, and government sources. For more information
        on the APIs, see: 'Nager.Date' <https://date.nager.at/Api>,
