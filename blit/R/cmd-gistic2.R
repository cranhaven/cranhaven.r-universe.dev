#' Run GISTIC2
#'
#' @description The GISTIC module identifies regions of the genome that are
#' significantly amplified or deleted across a set of samples. Each aberration
#' is assigned a G-score that considers the amplitude of the aberration as well
#' as the frequency of its occurrence across samples. False Discovery Rate
#' q-values are then calculated for the aberrant regions, and regions with
#' q-values below a user-defined threshold are considered significant. For each
#' significant region, a "peak region" is identified, which is the part of the
#' aberrant region with greatest amplitude and frequency of alteration. In
#' addition, a "wide peak" is determined using a leave-one-out algorithm to
#' allow for errors in the boundaries in a single sample. The "wide peak"
#' boundaries are more robust for identifying the most likely gene targets in
#' the region. Each significantly aberrant region is also tested to determine
#' whether it results primarily from broad events (longer than half a chromosome
#' arm), focal events, or significant levels of both. The GISTIC module reports
#' the genomic locations and calculated q-values for the aberrant regions. It
#' identifies the samples that exhibit each significant amplification or
#' deletion, and it lists genes found in each "wide peak" region.
