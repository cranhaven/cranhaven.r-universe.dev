Description: The goal of 'surveynnet' is to extend the functionality of
        'nnet', which already supports survey weights, by enabling it
        to handle clustered and stratified data. It achieves this by
        incorporating design effects through the use of effective
        sample sizes as outlined by Chen and Rust (2017),
        <doi:10.1093/jssam/smw036>, and performed by 'deffCR' in the
        package 'PracTools' (Valliant, Dever, and Kreuter (2018),
        <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-93632-1>).
