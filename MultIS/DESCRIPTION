Description: Tools necessary to reconstruct clonal affiliations from
        temporally and/or spatially separated measurements of viral
        integration sites. For this means it utilizes correlations
        present in the relative readouts of the integration sites.
        Furthermore, facilities for filtering of the data and
        visualization of different steps in the pipeline are provided
        with the package.
