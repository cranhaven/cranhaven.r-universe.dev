Description: We developed a comprehensive tool that helps with
        visualization and analysis of networks with the same variables
        across multiple factor levels. The 'netShiny' contains most of
        the popular network features such as centrality measures,
        modularity, and other summary statistics (e.g. clustering
        coefficient). It also contains known tools to look at the
        (dis)similarities between two networks, such as pairwise
        distance measures between networks, set operations on the nodes
        of the networks, distribution of the weights of the edges and a
        network representing the difference between two correlation
        matrices. The package 'netShiny' also contains tools to perform
        bootstrapping and find clusters in networks. See the 'netShiny'
        manual for more information, documentation and examples.
