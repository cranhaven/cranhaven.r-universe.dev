Description: Interfaces R with LSD simulation models. Reads
        object-oriented data in results files (.res[.gz]) produced by
        LSD and creates appropriate multi-dimensional arrays in R.
        Supports multiple core parallel threads of multi-file data
        reading for increased performance. Also provides functions to
        extract basic information and statistics from data files. LSD
        (Laboratory for Simulation Development) is free software
        developed by Marco Valente and Marcelo C. Pereira
        (documentation and downloads available at
        <https://www.labsimdev.org/>).
