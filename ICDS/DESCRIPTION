Description: Identify Cancer Dysfunctional Sub-pathway by integrating
        gene expression, DNA methylation and copy number variation, and
        pathway topological information. 1)We firstly calculate the
        gene risk scores by integrating three kinds of data: DNA
        methylation, copy number variation, and gene expression.
        2)Secondly, we perform a greedy search algorithm to identify
        the key dysfunctional sub-pathways within the pathways for
        which the discriminative scores were locally maximal.
        3)Finally, the permutation test was used to calculate
        statistical significance level for these key dysfunctional
        sub-pathways.
